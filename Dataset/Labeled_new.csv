"before buying the product, i did not think to test my laptop in my vehicle. if i had, i would not have bought this product. i have the version of streets and trips on my desk pc and use it a lot and thought it would be cool to get the gps version for my laptop to actually use on a real trip. the first time i tried to use it, i realized my laptop screen went unreadble in bright sunlight. my entire justification for buying went out the window. i did not need a second copy of s&t for a laptop and i certainly did not need the pricier gps version.",0
"i recently purchased catz for my son who is ll. he is a real animal lover and thought it would be right up his alley since he loves zoo tycoon. however, we found catz to be very juvenile for children in this age range. there is not much to do but dress your animals, bathe them, and plant flowers. true you can pet them, play with them, etc., but this is not entertaining for an ll year old. most of the games, like tic- tac-toe don't work, and the game ends up picking where your x will go. if you want an educational, stimulating game for your child, don't buy catz, unless your child is under the age of . any child above that age range will be bored within the first half hour.",0
"i really like norton internet security.he's really on the ball.i have it set to let me know if anyone tries to access my computer,and it does a great job.i was quite surprised to find out how many times a day my internet security was compromised!it was worth every cent!i would recommend it to anyone!",0
"just as some of the buyers have complained here in amazon.com, the &quot;convenient&quot; installation in this britannica dvd doesn't work. obviously, this is due to a bug in the program. so i have to keep the dvd always in the computer, an inconvenient option. the multimedia is not as bad as some encarta enthusiasts claimed. this dvd has great content and is good for adults and researchers. when i click &quot;islam,&quot; i get pages after pages of articles. you don't get that much from encarta.verdict: good for people and above. kids may not find it interesting.",1
"if you really want to learn french, this is one of the multimedia tools you can use. i lets you learn words, record them and listen back.",0
"i love the game! it's very realistic and fun. but sometimes when i play it, i never get past the original city to get my supplies. do not follow what your trail guide says about getting suplies. you always end up getting too much. when your out on the trail, make sure you have a gun and the stuff you need to work it, fishing gear, and plenty of vegetables. when you run out of meat, you'll need to hunt a lot. be sure to gather a lot too. especially right before winter, you can't gather then.",1
"my daughter ( yrs. at the time) loved this game. it is hard to find software that is really fun and educational at the same time. most of the software i buy for her, i have to load it and play at least once so that i can show her how to play. the zoombinis island odyssey was the exception. she had no problem playing it alone. it has a help screen with each activity that explains in detail. it is very easy to navigate and has multiple levels of play. we loved it so much that we now have the zoombinis logical journey and mountain rescue.",1
"although i did know some basic hebrew, this program has begun to teach me modern hebrew in a very effective way. i definitely would recommend it.some issues: currently there is no level . even after completing level , i think i will have a long way to go and will have to search out other learning approaches. although it runs in an ms window, i don't think it is a real windows program, so when going through the typing exercises, it gets glitchy at times. and some of the user interfaces are a bit awkward. for example in the typing exercises, it would be nice to be able to hit enter to submit your response, but instead you have to switch over to the mouse to push a button. also, to switch activities or lessons, there is no menu bar -- you have to hit their ""go back"" button.but overall, i am learning to speak hebrew.",1
a bit pricey for an opeating system ... windows xp pro is excellent ... but i think mr bill is gouging too much dough. one hundred dollar price tag would be a bit more humane ... to have billions is a bit redundand is dishuman ...,0
"very easy to figure out and use, the tools are basic but well chosen. it is showing its age and price range in a few places; only tracks supported, audio not supported, quantize is either full or none (no percent quantize or beat quantization). the biggest reason i continue using it is because the &quot;piano roll&quot; display mode is capable of showing all tracks on the same representational keyboard. wonderful for figuring out those interlocking horn parts. the biggest flaw (for me) is a poorly thought out and even more poorly documented patch naming system that forces me to go through screen after screen of unintuative choices if i change so much as one midi channel assignment on one piece in a session that week. i'd give it four stars, but the lack of audio makes it a poor contender in today's market.",1
"purchased psp studio recently and it wasn't able to open my nikon raw files (though the package says it does). i tried calling the tech support and was on hold for more than mins listening to how upgrading to their premium support would be of great value and finally gave up and hung up the phone.and one more thing, the tech support is not a toll free number and i was on hold for more than mins on a long distance call.",1
"i really like this game but i am annoyed that i can't find the last ladybug in the find me game. i can find no game hint support sites either. has anyone else had this problem? is it a bug (ha ha) in the program? i have spent weeks looking but always find the ones i've already found. can anyone out there help me? i am not a child, but my daughter can't find it either. apparantly the game will not finish until all bugs are found because i have found all the treasures. does this game not have more than one complete game to play? i thought it had like treasure hunt.thanks,",0
"excellent concept if you have more than one wireless computer on your system. automatically rotates your security key code (wep, etc) every hours on all your wireless computers to make it less likely that anyone else can use your system, although not fool-proof. slight difficulty configuring, but did recognize my wireless adapter and router. problem is that i lost connectivity to the internet a lot more frequently using this software; so much so that i decided to remove it from my system. once, i received an error message that ""security key rotation failed"". i use pc-cillin as my internet security/anti-virus. it may be that this program will gel more easily if you use mcafee products, but i don't know for sure.",1
"i recently upgraded from money . i was pleasantly suprised with the ability of downloading transactions for all credit card , bank and investment accounts. so all you have to do is check the info downloaded daily weekly whenever you want. had a little trouble with one investment account but overall was easy to setup. this is real nice for those of us who are not very fast on the keyboard.was hoping to get a product to help with retirement planning but after reviewing found it to be real weak in this area.",1
"onenote came with my new laptop (so i didnt have to put down almost $ on it) i find as college student, it's too much of a hassel to type instead of writing the old fashion way. i used onenote to take notes on a movie for a class and it was a hassel. also there's no way to save. if you want to type your note save money and use word instead.",0
"i ordered this for my middle school kids to get a good start on pre-algebra and algebra this summer. they both complain about how boring it is, and it is a fight to get them to use it. according to my kids, most of it is just text with a few short quizzes here and there. why isn't there a reader rabbit algebra!?",0
"this is the conclusion after reading all the reviews of previous products of encarta and encyclopaedia britannica and of my own experience. content wise, the eb is superior than encarta. yet eb software needs to be improved.the best way to get encarta to produce better software: ( ) boycott their products untill better ones are produced.( ) make public statements regarding their bad products.( ) direct complaints to the producer by phone and e-mail.if encarta, eb and other encyclopaedias (at least the software editions) merge it would be great. that would create the sole superencyclopaedia. another internet/super-information-highway! please make this matter public.",0
"the product is good, no doubt. the support that comes with it is poor.with and nt workstation you need to have only internet explorer (ie ), because the install of ie puts in files that are incompatible with the qb program.it took hours to install the program with research on the internet and on quickbooks site. if this is the version for why are they still using files from the browser install from ?(ie ).the phone in tech support does not even include install help for the program when you first buy it. good luck with it.",1
"the new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. it may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. this version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. this is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. if microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. the new version does not run macros as fast however. my recommedation for existing users: keep office for as long as you can and consider going to open office when microsoft no longer supports (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of ).",1
"i install it on my notebook dell inspiron . instalation was fine as usual. all hardware works at once except wireless card in wpa-psk and mb/s mode. to install native nvidia driver i have to read documentation, yast work is not enough. i was surprised when discover that double quote key doesn't work in us international keyboard layout in kde. also i cannot install/remove any software after initial instalation from yast, it is not able to find dvd in my drive. every application starts very very slow. compare to my previous suse . i would not say this distributive is better but hardware support is good.",0
"although humongous does a great job, there should be some changes. after a couple months my year old is starting to get bored with this one. the same items are always needed and they're always in the same place. unlike travels through time, which my daughter still plays after a year, the items are in different places and you have to listen closely to the clues each time. i hope that newer products will be better, not just different.",1
"i thought at first the first cd was good for beginners, it tought you basic words and they are easy to remeber. if you understand little of portuguese this would be good to refresh on but if you know portuguese i would say go with something else. it doesnt even teach you how to put sentences together like &quot;and, but, the,&quot; or any other words.",1
"the metroguide software for france is more useful than the us version. the maps seem more up to date, and, due to the difficulty of finding anything in france, much more useful. i managed to find our company's new building in a new town by punching in the address, and i was able to use my emap to find it in minutes from the train station. it also seems to have up to date restaurant and attraction info for paris and other areas.",1
"i did not find this product useful! so far, i have not found any new links or tree members as a result of this software (and i only have about a dozen at this writing). the software is slow and the search engines are poorly written (if you have a tree with only one member, and search for a surname beginning with 't', the s/w wants to start with the 'a' index). you cannot search a cd unless the s/w finds an index reference to that particular cd. the instruction manual is **really** bad - and lacks directions to 'advanced' features.",1
"smart suite millenium edition is quite a good office product; i have used it as a backup for ms office, when some files will not open in ms office, or if they fail, smart suite will open them, or ... and this is the best of it... it will actually repair corrupted ms excel and ms word files... it seems to restore the template.the biggest, and silliest ommission is lotus notes ,which is not on smart suite . .... the original smart suite millenium edition had the notes app in it, and losing a key product in the suite is such a disaster.as always, the organiser works beautifully... possibly the best pim this side of a palm pilot.the best bonus is that the basic apps will run from the disc alone. you do not need to install this suite to use the smartsuite basics, like wordpro etc... you can run this amazing product straight from the disc !!! can ms office do that ??",1
the games run and play well. there are only versions of dominoes to choose from. it will not keep track of your victories and losses. background music is anoying. it does have three different games that are not found on the hoyle board game software.,1

"an adequate low budget tool.very few plants that grow in south florida are in the database and i spent more time whiting out photos from my local nursury and neighbors in paint to import than designing my landscape. add-in plant files are expensive. anything that grows in my yard was only included as little houseplants, which is great if you live in new england and grow your crotons and hibiscus in indoor containers.not friendly to architecute outside the temperate zones.",1

"this product performs just as advertised, and does it efficiently. it doesn't handle all my password situations, however, such as when the user id and password have to entered sequentially rather than simultaneously.",1
this game can be fun. however if you are a person looking for a game that is close to reality this is not the right game. there is such a difference between having a real pet and this computer game. i don't recomend this game because i don't feel that it is worth the money. maybe i feel this way because i have a really puppy that i love.,0
"unlike norton, i have not had issues with win , , xp-pro, nor have i had to periodically reload the os on the ten assorted machines i have used this suite on, for many years.i would prefer less keystrokes to perform routine tasks, but will trade that for the lack of headaches and the very good os optimizing/maintenance. i use homebuilt desktops, sony, compaq, averatec and ibm laptops; all w/o problems; all run swiftly as the registry files are much smaller and my hds are optimized.my other gripe is the loss of multi-machine okay to run it, as with the older versions. there was no warning that my new version would restrict me to one computer, which happened to be an averatec that died. e-mail contact reset the license to my ibm laptop. i run the software i paid retail prices for in an un-updated mode (except for anti-virus and anti-spyware) on the others.i'd like to see an inexpensive multi-machine option offered.",1
"i am an avid user of paperport, have been for years since i received paperport . (or maybe earlier) version with my brother all-in-one.it is miracle software that is easy to use, easy to find documents, photos, etcetera.you can scan to it from your scanner or scan from it to your scanner, drag and drop stacks of documents, you name it!the only thing you can't do is get customer support to help you even if you pay the money!i recently upgraded from pp and now even though i can see my scanner on the list pp does not believe it is there.sounds simple and i've spent hours getting the information they requested after three weeks of waiting and then nothing, you cannot communicate with them, their faq is ridiculous, and their ""community"" forum format is the worst!good luck!",1
"working on a master's degree, i wanted to increase my productivity studying and less time typing, but it seems that writing the papers could be realistically more productive than talking to the computer.there seemed to be more negative comments than positive, and while some people may be technologically challenged, i'd rather save the money, and rely on good old-fashioned methods.as the old adage goes, ""anything worth doing, is worth doing yourself"".",0
"i tried the demo of pinnacle before settling on screenblast. screenblast is much more stable and easy to do the basics. although pinnicle seemed to have a few features that screenblast did not have, most of them are really not important. (for example, pinnacle can do storyboarding, were screenblast can not.)the biggest plus that i saw (besides the fact that it does not crash every minutes like pinnacle) was the pan and crop feature. this allows you to pan/crop a shot. this is great for adding 'animation' to your still photos, as well as other effects for video.the biggest draw back is clearly the dvd creation. my studio . is included and is a very weak software. the two are not integrated, so if you want to creat a dvd with multiple chapters, you have to go back through the camera. it is very disappointing.overall, this is a decent product compared to its peers, but still has a few holes.",1
"i did not appreciate a new version ( . )designed for vista being available week after my purchase in october, . there was no indication of the an upcoming proper ""vista"" designed version on the adobe website or amazon.",0
"o.k.--let me first say this--i'm no prude by any means-- but was all the sex really that necessary? it was to the point of being gratuitous. i mean, we are all sexual beings, but this film went a tad overboard with the heterosexual as well as the homosexual sexual escapades.other than that, i really liked this movie. the acting was superb by everyone. jullianne moore has always been a favorite of mine--why she hasn't snagged as oscar yet is beyond me. her performance is matched by annette bening. i'm convinced, come awards season, nominations will be kind to them both. and what can you say about mark ruffalo???--he is just beyond sexy in this film.i just wish the film had a little less sex and a little more moore/bening dramatic interaction.",0
"while this product is functional and relatively easy to use, it seems to struggle to keep even the smallest projects together. my latest project, a minute production with mostly still images and mp music, continued to crash until i removed all of the music and readded it. the product has a self update feature that prompts you when there are fixes available. while this is a very nice feature, i have patched it at least three times and the product still seems to have many bugs. if you have endless patience and enjoy battling frustrating software this is the product for you. two stars is probably generous.",1
"i was disappointed because it did not do what i needed done and it was not possible to determine that without working with the product. description led me to believe it would do something that i needed done. instead, i find that i need to purchase another microsoft product to complete my task. however, i am reluctant because i still may not be able to do what needs done and instead will be out even more big $$$.",0

i started useing this product three months ago a couple of hours a night on the average and am now ready for an actual class. i really love this set of cds titled instant immersion german. i have learned a lot; this is a winner in my book and i have never had a problem loading it on my pc.. this language set of cd's is good for beginers. my young children love it too; they think it's just plain fun..david g.,0
"after using the suite for a few weeks, i have to agree with one of the other members who gave it a high rating and questioned why there were so many people bashing this version. so far, i find this version to be very user-friendly and i absolutely love the new features. excel is much better and offers a wider range of functions. i was one of the people who actually got frustrated about the fact that 'conditional formatting' was so limited in earlier versions of excel. powerpoint is also drastically better in this latest version. i would definitely have purchased this item if i did not get it for free. i recommend it to anyone.as someone stated earlier, this takes getting used to like any other new product. why release a version if they were just going to make a carbon copy of ? this furthers my belief that people hate change no matter what it is. just take some time and tinker with the program and you'll eventually get used to it.",0
"amazon needs to provide a track listing for this e.p., and i, alas, am unable to do so and will thus be considered unhelpful, though that's more their fault than mine. but of the song which gives this disc its name, i can only say: ""yeah, we're wating around... uh huh.. we ain't doing anything... oh yeah, waiting on our butts... oh yeah..."" ..... nice inspiring anthem, ya fool!",0
"i have used this software now for a week and am still struggling with it. i think the product is powerful, maybe too many features for my needs, but figuring out how to use it is really tough. the users manual was clearly written by someone for whom english is a second (maybe third) language. if you are willing to make the effort to fight through this, you can do a lot. i have now used the note processor like a word processor to document music i have written and i have entered music from the virtual keyboard. it is so much nicer than my handwriting.",1

"our new pc is a hp pavilion c that came with windows xp home edition. this review will be breif, as i have only used it for a month now. my main pros are that things that pointlessly took forever can now be done really quickly. also, some features have been greatly expanded. my cons are that it is too ""automatic"". sometimes, you need to do things manually, whih often isn't in xp. also, i've already noticed some software compatibility probs. could be better, could be worse. if only i had e-mail up and running, i could give xp home edition my actual rating, which is (drumroll please!): / stars!",0
"although the age category begins at for this game, my year old (and i must confess, i too) find this game montonous and frustrating. the reason is the inability to quick save during the game...you can only save a game after you successfully complete each level.if you are in the middle or even near the end of a level, and you run the misfortune of using up your last life, you are brought back to the beginning of that level...too much jumping over water!!! my son loved the movie, but has given up on this game...disney needs to go back to the drawing board on this one...",1
this is so easy to use! i saved over . in just two projects. it paid for itself fast and now i have more time to really focus on my projects. my wife is able to do all the paperwork etc. without having to ask a million questions. no more frantic &quot; th&quot; of the month. my home buyers have a great feeling of professionalism about my work... thank you allan wolkenhauer,0

"pooh cd is really great for - year olds. it offers several - (!) various activities. all of them are interesting and useful in some way. each has different difficulty levels, so your child can grow with the program. the visual quality is extremely high and this software can work on older pc. i run it on my old piii without d card and was very happy.mickey cd has a couple of activities, but they are either not challenging enough or, when challenging, are too boring. i doubt your child will be using it much.overall, the pooh game is so good, it makes the whole package worth the money.good luck!copyrighted by me",1

"this program cannot work with commercial dvds directly. that means that in order to copy them, you would have to use a second program to decrypt and copy the dvd to your hard drive, after which popcorn can deal with it. while it works, it's a little clumsy.it would have been easy for roxio to get this program to work with commercial dvds. they chose not to.sadly, there are no very good options on the mac; ""dvd backup"" does the job, but has been buggy, is shockingly overpriced, and surgically grafts itself to your computer (if you have more than one computer, you can only run it on one of them, and must go through a song and dance to switch it between machines.)",0

"last year, i switched from turbotax to taxcut. the main reason being that the makers of turbotax decided to include a piece of spyware with their software which couldn't be deleted from your computer. plus, you had to jump through considerable hoops in order to even install it. no more of that nonsense for me.taxcut, to be honest, seems to be a step behind turbotax. not a huge step, but a step nonetheless. the program is intuative enough, and will get the job done for you without the hassles though. basically, it's a trade off. you get slightly less functionality with whole lot less hassle.",1
"this is an excellent product for converting vhs tapes to mpeg files for making dvds. i didn't really care about the tv feature as my main objective of buying this product is to convert vhs tapes to dvds, but the tv feature works very well also. if you read cnet or other sites you will see that this product gets bad reviews, i think it's because of the old driver, i use driver version . and it works the first time without a problem. this thing does the mpeg encoding in the hardware so it does not hog your pc like software encoding, the quality of video is excellent. as of this writting i see there are 'used' prices on here at $$$, i wish i had checked here first :) it's a bargain at $$$.",1

"overall, this product seems to work pretty well. i've been able to backup individual files, and restore them at will. i've made full system backups, but since i haven't had a reason to resore them yet, i'll have to reserve judgement on that portion.most of my gripes are over fairly small items. for example, you can schedule your backups to run automatically at the interval of your choosing, but after every backup the disk ejects. so you need to make a habit of reinserting the disk after every backup. why not give the user the option to eject after backup?the other buggy thing that i've found is that in their file manager, where you pick which items you want to backup, the sort by name doesn't work. you can try to use this sort option, but it's pretty random.other than that, it's a decent package.",1

"i have used mappoint for about three years now and i just upgraded. overall, it is an excellent, full-featured product that is very intuitive and easy to use.i use mappoint along with a full-blown professional arcview-based gis system. i find that mappoint allows me to perform &quot;quick and dirty&quot; and relatively simple gis tasks without having to get into the more complicated and time consuming - albeit more capable - arcview gis system.truth is, i could probably rely completely on mappoint except for one shortfall in the program. you can only create customized boundaries based on the pre-existing included boundaries (census tracts, zip code areas, etc.).for example, rather than being able to go in and create a boundary around a neighborhood, i have to conform this &quot;custom&quot; boundary to something like zip code boundaries or census tracts, etc. that are inluded in mappoint.microsoft, include this feature in mappoint and you will get -stars!",1

"it's amazing to think that anyone would buy this program when it can be downloaded from the microsoft site for free. if you need a cd, then order microsoft's book, ""build a program now!, microsoft visual basic express edition"" by patrice pelland for about a third of the price. the cd comes with the complete program.the two stars are for sticking it to the consumer and does not reflect on vb express itself. the program is quite good and an excellent way to get started with programming--especially with the ""build a program now!"" book.",1

"i downloaded this software to convert a two-page pdf document into an editable word document. much of the text converted well but the more complex areas of my pdf file, those that were contained inside of tables, were poorly done. portions of it were rendered as images(!), while other parts came through properly as text inside of tables. however, much of that text was inside of frames, or even nested frames. frames are word objects that are tricky at best, and frustratingly hard to deal with at worst. removing a frame often removes its contained text as well. either way, editing the converted document so as to make it look like the original was very difficult. in the case of the portions that converted to images, it was impossible.the product installs/uninstalls easily and seems to run well. if you're converting simple pdf files, this product may do the job but for complex documents, especially ones containing tables, i would not recommend it.",1

photosuite looks like it will be a good program if i can ever learn how to use it. i think it would be easy if there were any instructions provided with the program. there is a booklet provided with the program that shows what you can do with the program but not how to do it. very frustrating! i can see the tools on the screen but can't get them to work. i do not appreciate having to spend my very limited time trying to make the program do things i am sure it can do. i don't mind printing a users manual from a readme file but the readme file appears to be only for trouble shooting. i would not recommend this program simple because of the lack of documentation available.,1
"my cd-rom does include the japanese lessons. i find this product extremely accessible and very nicely structured. the lessons progress in easily understandable segments. for me, it is an ideal way to start learning a new language, as you always have a reference between pictures, the written, and the spoken words. my only criticism is that i would prefer some grammatical explanations, especially for chinese and japanese.",1

"i think that people who are used to the old microsoft interface are struggling to have an open mind:the ribbon is so much more intuitive than the former menus.i'm not a techie; just your basic-level end user. i love the new features. for example, when i click ""insert textbox"" it gives me a whole bunch of options that make producing an eye-catching newsletter a cinch.i didn't give it five stars because it's a real hassle that you cannot easily send a word document as an email. that is a serious step back in terms of functionality.",0
"when it comes to setting up a more complex route, google maps beats this hands down, but if you want that info in your garmin gps you don't have much choice than to use this. only shows the total distance for a route, not to the different waypoints you might have programmed. adding a waypoint requires you to find it first, save it, and then add it to a route. and if you interupt a route along the way, when you resume it your gps will try to get you back to the original starting point, and then it will skip all the remaining waypoints in your route, only showing the final destination.in a nutshell, the user interface needs a serious overhaul.wish it was mac compatible. works ok on a pc, but the transfers of data can take up to minutes (when routes that touch states are in the system), and if you try to skip the maps part thinking they're already in the device you will be sorely disappointed.",0
"i have to agree with all these reviews already posted. i was getting error messages for intuit stating that i would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so i ordered a new copy of quicken for $ thinking it would be an upgrade. to my amazement, it is exactly the same as quicken , no real developments. i feel very cheated by intuit. if was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. if they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, i would at least expect and improved product. they are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. i have been buying turbotax every year, and have been a loyal quicken user for many years, but now i think i will look for something else.",1
"this product is a handy way to load up the topos you need for whatever trip you are planning. i recently uploaded some topos onto my gps unit and took them on a multi-day river trip. the maps were adequate to tell me where on the river i was, with some of the undeveloped campgrounds even listed. however being : , the detail was poor and the contours had unusual intervals like a foot contour, just below a foot contour. i suspect it is a metric to english conversion thing. the other thing that was clunky about the software is that feature labels are fixed, so that unless you are zoomed way out, often you cannot tell the name of a creek, river, lake, or road without scrolling all around to find it. overall, it was worth the money for the coverage, but was not an exceptional product. garmin should really add : topos to its software selection, even if you had to buy them individually or by state, it would still be worth it.",1
"i bought this product, along with route europe, just before a trip to germany and the netherlands.route worked great with the gps receiver, and allowed us to go almost anywhere we wanted to with no difficulty (except for one way streets!). this software was so well thought out that we used it without even reading any of the instructions.when we got back, i tried to use the microsoft software and am totally stymied because ms's own product is too stupid to find the gps receiver on com (even though windows device manager knows it's there, and route used it without any trouble). it shows only com's & are available, and doesn't offer any way to connect to the correct port.isn't it sad that the receiver works so well (ms doesn't manufacture this) but microsoft's software is, as usual, full of problems?route needs to make their software available with a gps device, and then there'd be no reason whatsoever to consider microsoft.",0
"the software has exactly the features i need, and i barely notice the impact on computer performance. the software developers are very responsive. at first i had problems with getting the serial # from amazon, but the developers promptly gave me a new #. when i got the software installed, there was one annoying bug, but within days, they fixed it and had a new version ready for download. since they include lifetime free upgrades, i was able install it and register it with no problems. i highly recommend this software. one nice feature that others seem not to offer is the ability to filter web based e-mail such as hotmail.",1
"we love the jeopardy game. the music and sounds are pretty real, the questions are challenging (there are several levels to pick from), and one, two or three people can play. the down side is that the game is extremely picky about correct spelling of the question, even if you've selected the lenient choice. but overall, we love the game.",1
"this game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. the only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. you either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like i did. my sister finished the ""castle"" in about hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. it is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.",1
"i have adobe . professional. most of the time i use adobe to convert file to pdf. i bought this software hoping to get cheaper product for our company new computer with the comparable quality. the software does convert the file to pdf. however, it considerbly increases the file size.i convert some documents using both adobe and this software to compare.adobe compressed the file from kb to kbthis software increase the file size from kb to kb!changing the setting also makes no difference.not recommend this software if you're looking for the product to compress the file.",1

"i am an adult trying to learn piano. this program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.the lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play. the feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length. however, it does not track the strength of your key press.i would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs. also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher.",1
"i have not yet been able to use this product. if you do not own a camera that is truly digital, you are required to purchase a device that will convert the images. it costs $ or so. haven't gotten around to ordering it yet. i am sure it's a great program, though. wish i would have known this prior to ordering the product.",0
"got this program when it was first out when there was a special deal locally. i figured for [$$]it was worth a try.i use it often and really like the feature that let's you save an image for the web. it's saved me much grief and lots of hassles.unfortunately the help on the program stopped working and a fresh installation didn't fix the problem. now the crop box no longer follows the cursor. (no, i don't have a virus present.)i'm hoping that if i update the v .x these problems will disappear but not counting on it.i recommend this program if you want some reasonable power and ease of use.",1

"this is really a fun program to use. if you like to 'burn' your own cd's, you can make very attractive, colorful labels for the cd itself and the jewel case insert. unlike one of the other reviewers, i found no difficulty at all running the software on my system; nor do i find it to be a memory hog. no crashes or freezes at all (i suppose this may be related to the particular system, in all fairness). you can make very colorful labels from the cd, which has many choices of art and layout, and customize them to your heart's delight. this is especially nice if you want to present a custom made cd as a gift to someone, or for business purposes. for business use, there is more conservative label artwork; and for the 'wilder' projects, there is appropriate artwork, as well, with much in between. it is very user friendly, easy and intuitive to use. i think you'll like it a lot!",1
"i have used this program on different computers over the past years so i do like it. it will set your computer back to exactly the way you left it.forget about viruses and poorly made software you installed.there are some caveats though. if you need to reformat or re-install windows, disable goback first or you will have trouble. also, if you have a compter like i do which has the instant on dvd feature, don't use goback. goback will work but you won't be able to boot into the instant on feature.",0

"ahh... mac os brings mac users back to the days of the classic interface - in days before aqua. this os is, in my opinion, possibly the best that apple ever did except in stability.mac os x resembles the classic ideas of macintosh operating system. however, it does not have the same overall feel. os x is not as &quot;snappy&quot; as mac os , especially on g computers. nine is much more easily customizable in looks than os x. i'm sorry, but the aqua interface is not very pleasing to me.now for you older users. i would definitely suggest this as an upgrade to os both functionality and compatibility.overall, mac os is a great system to have around. even if you are all-out os x but have used &quot;classic&quot; operating systems, keep os around because it sometimes feels good to come home to this wonderful interface.",1
"even though the stories are alright, the game just doesn't hold interest and doesn't have enough things for kids to do. there are better programs out there, and school zone does a lot of good ones. but this one is not rich enough to keep kids coming back after playing it through once.",1
"the gps works well (i.e. it tells you where you are on the map). as far as the routing, there are no voice prompts (helpful when driving alone), there is no distance countdown to the next turn (a great feature on other software), the zoom on the map resets itself when moving to the next turn instruction (zooms way out, quite annoying), the software does not automatically move to the next turn instruction (it really should when using gps), and the software does not automatically recalculate a route when deviating from the recommended route (you have to push a ""go"" button which can be tough while driving). all in all, this software works better if you plan on traveling with another person to operate the laptop.",1
"i recommend this product because of it's improvement in two general areas of disk defragmentation: ) it does most of its work in the background stealing idle cycles to defrag key files and keeping your disk somewhat tuned. ) it also has a more sophisticated tunning process. it can tune the master table in addition to just files, it also seems capable of defragmenting disks that the standard defragmenter cannot do (i never understood this limitation).i have noticed a significant performance improvement since i installed diskeepeer.",1

there is no manual included with this upgrade. there is a folded sheet with new product activation info. it is getting harder and harder to get a real manual with software. a pdf file is not a real manual. software gets more expensive yet we no longer get a hard copy manual. it would be nice if software companies at least offered a hard copy manual at an additional price.,0

endnote x was made typing research paper an enjoyable task. it is user friendly with its keyboard shortcuts and technical support assistance. this was the first time i have used citation software and endnote x made it easy for me to concentrate on the art of writing instead of shuffling through the apa manual to accurately cite a reference. it is definitely a must have for any student!,1
"we bought this software hoping, but not clear, that this would be additional software for the tonka dig-n-rigs game. if you are not familiar with dig-n-rigs, its a great game that comes with a dashboard unit that mounts on your computer keyboard. you load the software and then all of the controls are on this dashboard, like the steering wheel, crane levers, key, and horn. it is a -star game and my year old son said, after playing for a few moments that he would be playing the rest of the day and the rest of his life. we'll, just realize that construction is not a supplement to that game and you just use your mouse. its still a good game but not near as gratifying as dig-n-rigs, and i hope they eventually come out with supplemental software to that game.",1

upon using this software it has froze my windows os multiple times. walls do not auto-align and in one month's worth of use it has caused fatal errors.granted it's easy to use but for the price lacks the power of other layout software. i only use it because it is a common tool and file layout within my industry.,0
"i bought this game from a software club on a whim. my and year old boys were sort of interested in chess, and my husband's name is fritz. so i thought if i was lucky, the software could help them learn some of the basics of chess. it has far surpassed my expectations. they love it, and have spent hours playing it. they know how all the pieces move, have learned some of the finer points such as ""castling"", and still keep playing. i hear them repeating the little rhymes that the program uses to help them remember different strategies....""a knight on the rim is ugly and dim""....""pawns are afraid of nothing; they move straight ahead"", etc. in just a couple of weeks, they know way more than i know about chess. i would love to have this program in my middle school classroom, as i think my students there would enjoy it, as well.",1

"this is a very attractive looking entry level program that for the most part is relatively easy to use. simple to make basic cut and paste edits. filtering lacks the sophistication of more expensive products making its less than adequate if you are converting scratched vinyl records or older tape cassettes to cd. i used this product in conjunction with diamond cut millennium (a much more robust product designed for vinyl restoration) for seven months. the program documentation states that changes to your operating system may cause the program to inactivate your registration and stop working. in my experience, this happened and the re-activation process built into the program did not work. if this happens, you will find there is no support for this product. repeated e-mail efforts over a three week period produced no results. i was forced to replace the product with goldwave which seems to have a few more restoration type features but and is slightly more expensive.",1
the install took forever they dropped napster but still have the lame o drag n drop disc utility which is junk. so i decided to skip that on install. the gui is a bit more complex and it appears they want to steer away from novice users.the interface is complex and kinda hard to navigate. the first issue i came across is finalizing a disc (data) or any other for that fact. kinda hard to set. even has a finalizing tool??in the project menu??i dont get it??so you have to check then recheck to finalize any burn????ok.whatever.i backed up a movie as well no compression but chopped off menus etc. it took a bit of a long time in comaprison to nero . recode. i also have tried nero and it is horrible buggy mess.and im not too pleased with roxio either but to be fair i need to mess with it a little more however its ok i still prefer nero . which i think is thier best release to date,0

basically take rand mcnally tripmaker and update the interface. i don't even think they updated the road database (c) says but i must admit the interface is easier to use so if you are looking for a simple city to city travel guide (place to place will only work if the place you are looking for is in one of the full city guides they have in the program) that is easy to use then this is for you. if you want more map detail try streets and trips or delorme street atlas.,1

"i purchased this game after reading raving reviews about it...and i must say i was thouroughly dissapointed. i was bored with the game after a half an hour of playing it. there's really not that much you can actually do in the game. your catz just wander around a setting looking cute and fighting with the other catz. you can dress up the pets with a few outfits or try to play with them; they don't usually want to play with the toys. i did not have any luck with my cats having babies like i wanted them to, and it was very hard to train them. all in all, this game is not worth the money. if you really desire a virtual thing on your computer, buy the game babyz instead.",0

"we are remodeling our kitchen and bathroom and we bought this so we could make better decisions before we drop big bucks and start knocking down walls. our architect put together schematics and a cardboard model but interior designer brought it to a new level by giving us a full color d view of the end result.interior designer makes it incredibly easy to layout the walls, add doors, windows, and fixtures. it's super easy to click and drag cabinets, refrigerators, and other appliances into the design.the product is not perfect - there are some constraints that make it difficult to place appliances where they barely fit or add custom geometry that's outside the bounds of normal designs - but for $ i think this is an incredible product.using interior designer, we got a much better feel for our finished remodel. well worth the price.",1
"first of all, let me say that this is a great game. it's loads of fun for the whole family to play, and it runs smoothly on even my older mac g .that said. my whole family was stumped about what to do when plugging cords into machines in the game. if you've run out of plugs, the other end of the cord just floats there, and you cannot continue the game! nowhere in the manual does it mention that you can give up on a cord by pressing the 'esc' key. i suppose that's a good key to choose, and it makes sense, but they simply forgot to mention it in the manual, and we wasted a whole day trying to play the game and getting stuck over and over.",1
"i did not find this game to be as educationally sound as i would expect from sesame street. there is too much talking before the program will react to a command. the graphics are jerky and the cursor acts like the target is magnetically charged and keeps pushing away the cursor. when the child actually does manage to click on a target, the cursor may still fly to another target and the child is told that his answer is wrong. another example of educational problems is the pronunciation of ""eggs"" using a long ""a"" sound instead of a short ""e."" this is not very helpful in teaching a child the sound for short ""e."" children that are used to playing computer games by themselves may find that this game is too frustrating to do alone. the open ended learning curve is a great idea. i just wish sesame street would hire a truly qualified literacy expert to help clean up the many problems in this program.",1
"given the great reviews and honors i expected something special. but there wasn't a moment i wasn't aware of a script being acted out, actors being minutely directed (not one actor at any time looked relaxed or spontaneous), and some sort of social agenda going on, though for the life of me i still can't figure what that agenda was. i found the father being cast out as the devil and the mother who strayed being all sunshine, light and goodness treated as an angel at the end illogical and a false note. but, then, the whole film kept striking false notes for me. i guess one problem is i've known so many gay people with kids and in my experience nothing unusual or conflicting goes on in their lives that doesn't go on in anyone's lives. and none of their lives would make a movie, that's for sure.adrift in the heartland",0

"my seven year old twins sons can't get enough of this game.the game has two modes: solving a series of progressively harder puzzles, and free play where you build your own machines from scratch. they made it through the first couple dozen puzzles but when the puzzles started involving electric circuits, the boys couldn't solve them. i imagine they will be able to solve all the puzzles when they are a bit older.for now, the part that captivates them is the free play; they love coming up with wild machines that toss balls around, launch fireworks, etc. i can't count how many times i've been excitedly called into their room to review their latest creation.",1

"well, maybe i was expecting too much but for the $ + price i was expecting much greater coverage of the entire country. not being a prior fodor's guide user i was expecting this guide to be much more like the michelin guides i used when in europe. wrong! the level of detail and coverage outside of just a few of the major metro areas is minimal to nonexistant. this product should be called ""an overview of selected sites in north america"" not worth the money!",1

"i've used pc-cillin for several years and have generally been pleased. the newest version was a nightmare to install--so bad was the first try that i had to use system restore to get a semi-stable system back. note that i followed all of the directions religiously. i finally gave up on the firewall (admittedly, i had disliked their firewall in the earlier versions and used the xp firewall instead) and after four tries finally got the anti-virus part to install. that seems to work ok, but what should have been a ten-minute undertaking turned into a + hour ordeal. this product was definitely not ready for prime time.",0
"to the previous reviewer regarding internet activation policy.i can tell you that i recently purchased office pro, and i was allowed to activate the product twice. it is stated in the licensing policy that the product may be installed once on a permanent computer, and once more on a portable computer (ie: notebook, tablet etc.). this is exactly what i did. if the second computer was not portable, i don't think they would know this, and therefore you could actually install twice.hope this helps.",1

"i first realized that the product was limited when browsing the or so samples that come with the product i saw there were no split-level samples to use as a basis for modeling our existing home. after hours of tweaking with floor levels, wall heights and unintuitive invisble walls, i was able to get something resembling our existing br split-level, but it's off enough that my wife and i will not be able to get the kind of visualization we expected.invisible walls allowed me to approximate our multi-sloped roof, but the result is not very satisying for all the effort.on the other hand, if not trying to model a split-level, it is very easy to use, almost trivial, to pop out a model from a floor plan and the renderings look very nice.bottom line: i wish i had seen the reviews and known the big limitation before i bought the product from sam's club.",1

"i homeschool my daughter and know she needs to learn to type. i bought this product because of the brand name recognition. imo, there are not enough drills. she learned the homerow pretty well but then was expected to incorporate capitalization and numbers. she needed much more practice and drilling with lowercase a-z before she moved to capitalization and numbers. there aren't even any drills to do on our own, only dictation which includes, of course, capitalization, symbols and numbers.so i am in the market for an age appropriate product. she needs to be drilled a few letters at a time until those are habit.would not recommend for a person with no prior typing experience.",1
"this remains the best anti-virus software on the market. regretably, it offers little more than . other than scanning im from aol or msn, the program remains essentially the same. fortunately, it was a good program in and remains a good program in . i upgraded although probably should not have done it. it integrated with my system works, although you need to delete all existing applications from norton, including live-update, for a clean installation of your new program. then go back and load your older stuff. this is the secret to less headache. this is particularly true of windows os. the xp os provides a clean install without the hassle on antivirus with norton system works. it might be the same hassle had i elected to upgrade to system works. with the minor improvements, i do not intend on finding out. my advice is to pay the subscription update cost and wait for .",1

"this britannica cd is a wonderful reference tool for users of any age, now that it contains three different encyclopedias. so much information is provided at the touch of your keyboard and the britannica application contains the same information as the leatherbound version. the features that i find most useful are: interactive timeline, knowledge navigator, world atlas. each of them are packaged to help the user find certain information quickly. another reason why this product is handy is when multiple windows brought up during research can be save in the workspace feature. i am definitely impressed with it esp. when i have + windows opened to various britannica articles and need to save them so i don't have to go thru the torture of searching for them again. the only improvement this software might need is to speed up the installation time. it took me about minutes to install the whole product on my win computer.",1

i do not recommend this program for garden design. it has a vast number of plants to choose from and although they are broken down into catagories you will not be able to search for a specific plant and the pictures are small and hard to recognize. i spent hours looking through the perenials hoping to find that i wanted for my bed only to have the program lock-up on me. oh well...i do like the home design and floorplan trace.,1
"the new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. it may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. this version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. this is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. if microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. the new version does not run macros as fast however. my recommedation for existing users: keep office for as long as you can and consider going to open office when microsoft no longer supports (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of ).",1

i had used turbo tax for several years but surely there is a better program available. the program with the state download &quot;free&quot; had glitches in it and would not setup. contacting customer service was a difficult ordeal to acquire a replacement per instructions within the software. after waiting a very long time on the phone to talk to someone they argued that i buy it even though it came with my program as a &quot;free download&quot; and then even the replacement download was difficult to setup and expired after hrs. customer service does not want to hear they have defects in their software even after a very long wait on the phone to talk to them. i cannot recommend turbo tax software and will try something different next year.,1

i have purchased this and already used it in mexico. it is helpful to get you to any of the major cities but even within guadalajara it was clearly very dated and did not compare favorably with a gps that my friend was using that he purchased in mexico.i bought the garmin gps specifically so i could use this map in mexico. i called garmin and asked when an update would be available and was told they have no plans to update. when traveling to ajijic it did not show any streets or even a road to get to the city. ajijic is on the shore of lake chipala -- the largest lake in mexico.let us hope with that with more requests garmin will finally update this map. it is at least five years out of date.ks,1

"i have tried the trial versions of several different entry level video editing programs and decided to purchase the sony vegas movie studio. vegas movie studio platinum seems to have the best features and is a stable application. it allows video tracks to be set up simultaneously as well as supporting dolby . sound. i believe it gives you a little more control over some of the effects although you can set up transitions fairly fast if you want to. the one defect i have found is the rendering speeds (hence the stars). it can take - times as long to render a video as it did to actually take the video footage. i am also using a trial version of womble and it renders at roughly - times faster than vegas movie studio. that is a big difference when you are rendering a hour video. other than that rendering issue, i think vegas movie studio has more features than most of the other programs and seems to be more stable than a couple of the other video editing programs that i have tried.",1

"it is great for making mp s ... the only problem is that it only allows one to make mp s before it asks you to go to their web site to buy an unlimited mp maker plug-in for the program. at the mp site, you have to give all of your information, including credit card number, before you find out what you are paying for the plug-in. also, i think that they will release your private data to others, or at least that is the way that it appears. it does, however, restore older music very well ... but is it really worth the additional unknown cost when there are other similar products available that are complete when you buy them? i avoided buying the mp plug-in come-on and use other programs where the consumer is not duped into thinking he bought a complete product, only to find out that what he bought was not what he thought.",1

"framemaker is essentially a very fancy wordprocessor. adobe is pushing it because of its capabilities to output books in different media--print, pdf, and html (web)--from the same file. actually, it does this very well and probably has the best mechanism for producing mathematical formulae around. for most of us in the desktop publishing/web publishing business, though, it is not the right tool. it is still faster and easier to use good old word with quark and illustrator or freehand for creating pages and adobe acrobat and macromedia's dreamweaver for pdf files and web pages.finally, framemaker is just too expensive for most of us and its high price means that, even if you can afford it, the people with whom you may need to share files, won't have it on their computers.adobe gives out a demo. try it out before you buy this. they are also running an ebook seminar at various places around the country which features a big section on framemaker. it's free. go to their website for info.",1

(yes, we were above the minimum system requirements with the second computer.) the choices for clothing and stage setting are limited and not fully interchangeable. most of the dances were one move repetitions once they got into presentation. the speaking parts were halting and the movements were either jerky or sluggish. we may have had a bad cd, but i don't think so. gamers, buy this one with caution.",1

"i use this product to edit digital home videos. it has good functions to work with scenes, add sounds, music etc. and controls my canon camera without problems.what i do not like is the quality of the encoders. rendering movies to mpeg (and burning it to svcd later) shows artifacts and lower quality than you get with other freeware encoders. here pinnacle has to improve. beside that it is a good product - installation and operation went well for me without crashes so far.be sure to get enough memory and diskspace though - i now run with mb and gb - and disable all other processes on your system not to lose frames when capturing or writing back to your camera.",1

"for the most part, partition magic does the basic functions for which it's designed. i used it primarily to change cluster size on my ntfs file system. the scary part is that they only offer support through a form you fill out on their website and, in my experience, they don't bother to reply to that. since it's not a real e-mail address, you don't even have a record of your original message. there is phone support if you want to pay $ more ($ after hours).if your interest is in their datakeeper program (included with partition magic), you should know that when you use it to backup file systems other than your c drive, it will also monitor your c drive whether you want it to or not. this can slow down your system considerably if it starts backing up system files which are constantly changing.in general, partition magic is great if you don't run into any problems, but data keeper, as simple as it is, still needs work.",1

"the good:fantastic design, perfect graphics even on x screen where other kids softwares shows only a small window. this one is full screen and great image quality. also very good music and voice quality. the game generates surprises when you search for things. the characters ask you for things you need to search to help them. so far so good.the bad:after playing the game (helping my son) for about hours from beginning to end, my mind was numb and i was nervous.the suggetion:instead of buying computer games for you kids, just go in the garden with them and let them help you water the plants and such things. works with my kid, gives him exercise too.",0

"i'm a musician with a home studio built around a windows xp machine, and was looking to add an ibook to take advantage of music programs not written for windows. i spent some time with this and other machines in an apple store and concluded that i'll put up with windows--and buy about % more laptop for the same price--rather than being straight-jacketed by this overly designed and clunky user interface. i'm one of those creative types that's not afraid of technology and am really, really demanding of flexibility in the operating system. windows does this so much better than os x, at least for my needs. and not having access to two buttons is the final killer. whether on the net, in photoshop, or in reason, i don't want to have to hit control to bring up a contextual menu. i'm kind of shocked, since so many people rave about this os. huh.",0
i just bought this map of the usa. the last time i looked the united states of america included alaska and hawaii. well in small print on the box this product is only for the 'continental usa'.besides missing two areas i wanted it is good for mapping out a trip and finding the mileage. i have not tried loading to my gps or palm pilot yet.,0

"garmin is great, but amazon when i called to talk to them about getting the additional software for my garmin i purchased at christmas, they sold/sent me the dvd version which is not the correct item. you need the sd card version so it fits into the garmin. i called garmin and they walked me through on how to use the dvd. i had to go and buy a g card and then download the dvd and then transfer it to the card..and of course it didn't all fit on the card so i had to delete some countries..it was a mess..i couldn't return the dvd since i had already opened it. the product of the maps are great but amazon should have known that the dvd version was obsolete and not sell it.",0

"while this particular product, cd creator . , may work fine in most cases if you choose to use the default installs and not take two (see previous reviewer), i rate roxio a minus one, and therefore the product a two. if you use windows and have multiple disks or dual boot, forget it. not only does the product not do well if you try anything sophisticated with it, but the company won't help you either.the support for their products is very poor. not only do you have to call a toll number and have to wait on hold for upwards of an hour, but they are extremely unhelpful online as well. i would really recommend against any product from this company at all until the support attitudes and policies are changed.please, let everyone you know who is looking for cd creation software know to shy away from this company and their products.",1

i was not completely satified with this software. it was not made clear that i would have to buy more software to complete my genology search.,0
studio is an easy to use integrated solution for anyone who wants to photo edit easily and cheaply.its adobe competitors bloatoshop and elements both require mb ram and xp to run. studio only needs mb ram and runs on win also so is the only option if you have a pc with these specifications. of course it also runs on xp with mb as well.the interface for studio is much more intuitive than the adobe products and is much easier to use and learn. there are also many books and websites available to take you as far you want to go with studio.the only minor criticism is that studio is bundled with photo album standard rather than advanced. it would be nice to get the advanced version in the bundle.bottom line: if you are a photo enthusiast who appreciates an easy to use and good value photo editor then studio is for you.on the other hand if you like doing things the hard way and enjoy paying through the nose then adobe will gladly separate you from your money.,1
"well, actually, i've never been able to talk to tech support. i've had the version for months, i can no longer call them for tech support. they don't tell you your tech support will run out when you renew. i spent minutes on hold through automated operator hell before finding out nobody would help me. strange, i never needed tech support until a day after it ran out and my system did a live update...almost as if they are forcing me into upgrading to a newer version.also, if you order this prodcut, be aware that about months before it runs out they will start encouraging you to renew it for another year. don't renew until the last minute. if you renew early, your year long subscripion starts the day you renew, not the day it was due to run out. they don't tell you that either.the actual program is pretty user friendly.",1
"this is the ultimate project planner for me. instead of having pieces of my work in word, excel and html, everything nicely fits in onenote. i downloaded the trial version. but it has become so indespensible i'm going to have to buy a copy. having said that, this is version one. and i suspect microsoft will have many improvements to make in future editions.",1
"i purchased pinnacle express to transfer my pinnacle studio projects to dvd. unfortunately, the two products are not well integrated. express will only import avi files; thus, the projects that i made in mpeg format had to be redone. analog input is not supported, only digital via firewire. when scenes were relocted, the final product had hiccups on transition. editing in express is limited and clunky, particularly when compared to studio's polished editing features. also, the maximum movie length is about an hour when including a menu. other dvd authoring software is capable of up to two hours. on the plus side, the menu creation feature is excellent, with a number of preset menus as well as the opportunity to create custom menus. if you want a program that will capture and burn your dv movies with limited editing, this product will meet your needs. as for me, i will probably purchase ulead's dvd workshop after my trial month is up.",1

"a waste of time and money.poorly animated.not appropriate for the targeted age. buttons to advance pages are not highlighted. it's not clear when an activity ends or how to advance to the next page.the story writing activity is horrendous, incoherent, and filled with non-sequitors. the premade stories illustrate this perfectly.the pinball game is too hard and has no educational value.the card writing activity is too limited, and again not clear how to advance through the different steps. the shape matching activity is noisy, gives insufficient reward for completing the task and doesn't indicate clearly when the child has completed all the tasks. the music activity is confusing, insufficiently interactive, although the music itself is high quality. overall, this software has a few good ideas, but some are just plain bad and boring. it also suffers from poor execution and obviously insufficient play testing. the jumpstart programs are a little better.",1

(i am running a ghz machine with megs of ram) it takes almost minutes just to start the program and several minutes to load an existing project. i have also had problems with it when it finds a bug: you correct the bug and it will not let you back in to edit. you have to restart the program. furthermore the documentation is garbage. it takes forever to search the msdn help and then returns incomprehensible articles often that are not on the correct subject. examples used are extremely complex instead of explaining things are a showcase for some ms programmer to show how smart he is. furthermore if you think this is basic, think again. this language shares almost no relationship to the old vb or earlier visual basics. as far as microsoft is concerned basic is dead.",0
"this product does allow some great web site building capabilities, however, i did not like the fact that if you did not subscribe to a website hosting company that supported microsoft frontpage server extensions, which only about or so did, then you could not use many of the features when you published the website (i.e. submit forms, e-mail, surveys, etc.) this made many of functions useless.

i bought this game for my years old daughter. while the game does have a few good ideas and moments i wouldn't say that it's a good product. at the age of kids needs to be pulled in the educational game instead of being forced by the parents. this game in some situations looks like a definite overkill for years old while in others it's too simple. the one thing is certain - my daughter is not engaged and it takes a lot of efforts to ask her to play on a computer this game which never happened before. so while this game does have a few good ideas and is a decent learning product it's far from being perfect or even good enough.,1

"i updated my garmin nuvi which had a na map using the sd card version, no problems loading. however, i was disappointed to find this map has marginal updates. my home address in a subdivision that is + years old is still not available on the map. mapquest, google, even tomtom all have my street address but not garmin.likewise, points of interest that have been around to years were not always found. again, i checked a tomtom gps and it had the hotels, restaurants i was looking for. with the price of gps' dropping fast and garmins lack of most current updates, i probably avoid buying updates from garmin again.",1

"since amazon recommends buying both the standard and the preferred speech versions together, i am puzzled as to why. do people buy both the standard and the preferred speech version in order to make one version work? is there a reason that people would install both versions on there computer? if the standard version does so well, then why buy the preferred speech version? is the extra money for the preferred speech worth it?i've noticed in the preferred speech review, many of the reviewers refer to the preferred speech version as ""dragon naturallyspeaking."" this to me adds to the confusion of what is being reviewed and blurs the line between the two products.",0

"i purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking (which i usually never do, usually i just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing.) i came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product. of course, you could acomplish this with ms paint if you really wanted to.one of the main (and only, in my opinion) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting. that alone makes it worth the dollars you put into it.one downside is that this program, because of it's many tones, uses and requires quite a bit of space. when i uploaded it on my laptop,it slowed down significantly. so much so that now i load it when i want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again! xdoverall it deserves about - stars. ^.^",1

"this dtp software is a classic. it is mature and stable. for long documents like books or manuals it is a good choice. it may be a little too mature, though. the underlying technology is -bit code that does not take advantage of today's modern operating systems. the user interface looks like something coming from the s. in the book publishing market there is not much of a competition, so adobe may think they could get away with this. but they can't really. compare corel's ventura publisher . it is also an excellent choice for books and long structured documents. it is based on up-to-date -bit technology and a the printing engine from corel draw. the modern user interface is very similar to the recent versions of corel draw. so, adobe needs to do more than they did for this upgrade to keep framemaker competitive, esp. they when they charge that much money for it.",1

"pros: program is very useful for beginners, intermediate and expert users. depending on your desire to do a simple movie with little effort, with basic transitions or to spend a lot of time creating movies with the professional look, you can do it all. i'm just beginning to address some of the many possibilities which seem to be endless.cons: i'm unable to see the real time video using the monitor (video is too choppy), even after rendering it. the only way for me to see the clip in real time, is to export it to an avi file and view it windows media player. then going back to further edit the movie if needed.i currently have a dell desktop with xp-sp , mb memory, . mhz cpu gb hard disk with gb available. planning on increasing memory to gb, hoping that it will help.",1
we had a quick response need to generate a complex interconnection diagram and one person on staff with some experience with an ealier version of visio. this combined with some serious power point and excel capability (and amazom overnight delivery) gave us good working second revision within hours. so far we're very satisfied.,0

"i'm not sure why there are those who say the program is bloated. the program is large, no question, but it covers a lot of ground. the disc authoring alone is huge as there are a lot of disc types it covers. apparently burning data and music are vastly different, which i found when i used this program. it takes a lot more time burning music which is due to coversion and having dolby stereo audio. it's not just the size of the files that affects the burning time.the photo editing program is very comprehensive and this is like a packaged program by itself. add to that the slide shows and other projects and the suite offers a lot of photo project features. it may be huge, but i think all the programs are of use.",1

"don't be confuse this product with high end video, photo, and sound editing programs. the biggest advantage is the disc authoring program. i've been burning loads of discs, mostly dvd-video formated ones. this is the easiest program i've used so far. i'm surprised how many formats are included now.yes, this is great for disc burning. at the price point though the editing tools are not as rich as pro level packages. i still use a professional high end program to edit sound. that being said, i've been able to make quick fixes with the roxio sound editor. most people don't need the level of detail that i use so it's more than sufficient. it is also quick in making your cards, photo slide shows, collages, labels, and menus. if you need pixel editing, again this isn't the program. but if you can make due with the basics like cropping, color changes, cloning, then i'd consider this package.",1

"being a member of the nigerian diaspora, i bought this software hoping to get a refresher on igbo. it was too low level, plus it was very awkward to wathc caucasions mouth the words; but to hear an african actually say the words.if you're looking to learn a few words quick, it should do the trick. for anything more, maybe take a class, or get an advanced book.",1
"i bought cdroms from this company, piano for my kid and guitar for myself. neither does a very good job of teaching. this one is by far the worse of the two. my biggest problem is the lessons are very scattered. you are expected to go from point a to point d, skipping b and c. the playback on the songs isn't very flattering, as it is midi with no real guitar sounds. the instructor is straight out of the eighties with his big hair, so if anything i got a good laugh.",1
"i've tried several programs to &quot;clean up&quot; cd's that were recorded from scratchy vinyl and the audio cleaning lab works the best. i use it on my lap top computer to restore and clean audio files. using the product to burn cd's is not a problem for me as it is for some of the other people who have reviewed this product - and i also have easy cd creator installed. just to let everybody know, there is a limit to how much cleaning the product will do for you - the worse shape the original source, the harder it is to clean the material. overall, i've enjoyed working with this product. highly recommended for the price!",1

why would you buy this when you can download it for free? all you are paying for is some of the applications that are licenced. you can download this and other linux distrobutions from linuxiso.org. if you don't have a speedy internet for big downloads (around megs) then go to osdisk.com and find a good selection of distros to order for a great price.,0
"this movie started the trend of video game movies that were actually good...sadly a small trend. this movie did the best they could with the material they got. unlike its horrible sequel. they used the characters good, not too many or with horrible acting.now the reason i didnt give this a perfect score is simple. its not perfect, they did some major changes to the storyline especially to that of scorpion and sub-zero hatred towards each other. its only mentioned once by shang tsung as them being bitter rivals.another good aspect was how they did goro. i still dont know how they did it.buy this moviepros:-did the best they could-gorocons:-change of pace of storyline",0

"i have used quicken for over years. this version is probably the worst yet. it reserves huge amounts of screen real estate for quicken advertisements and messages. two examples of the steps backwards: ( ) you can no longer work while downloading information and ( ) you cannot suspend your computer while quicken is running. it says &quot;quicken does not support standby mode.&quot; they've changed to user interface for the worst. for example, reconciled items are now grayed out, with no way to change it back to normal. also, the investment transaction register now doesn't show the comment lines.i have found no substantial improvement. the business features, in particular seem the same or worse.i think quicken has decided they're a monopology and don't have to try anymore.",1

"i bought this for a th grader in advanced math. to be frank, the software is boring. you can be lectured to in one program or take quizzes in another. there's no interactivity - kids will become tired of this software quickly. the publishers quality control is lax too - one screen showing topics to be quizzed on listed ""additionition"" among its offerings.the grade range says grades - but it has concepts (like addition) suitable for lower grades. kids in those lower grades will find the software even more boring.i had no trouble installing the software and running it under vista, though it takes a really long time to install and uninstall. i'm returning this software - don't make the same mistake i did and skip this product (i bought it in a store on impulse...no reviews to guide me.)",1

"this software is easy to use and is much better than a book. this is because vietnamese is a tonal language, so the word ""ba"", for example, could have several different meanings depending on whether you use an ""up tone"", a ""down tone"" or a monotone. unless you can actually hear the differences with your own ears it's very difficult to learn the nuances, which is why i would always recommend a software program such as this which lets your both see the sentences and hear them over your speakers.the only thing keeping the program from getting five stars is that you have to exit about four different screens in order to get out of the program. also, some of the stock photos they use to identify the phrase in question are clearly not vietnamese people or places. it would have been nice to have seen it be a bit more authentic.",1

office is what it is - we are all stuck with microsoft's casual disregard for millions of hours of macro programming and keystroke commands hardwired into our fingers that evaporate with the next version. but the box on this one really ticks me off - it could be a slim biodegradable cardboard box but is instead a large hard plastic box impossible to file and millions of them will eventually be circling the great pacific garbage gyre. just because you are the pound gorilla doesn't mean you should sit anywhere you want.,0

"as this was the first of the battleground series that i acquired, i was impressed with the ease at which you could enter into the ambience of the civil war and move to the business end of the game. the videos and music were initially welcome and the graphics clean and quick to refresh. the toolbars are excellent and everything about the game made the length that i spent playing it most enjoyable. the only drawback is that battleground is so good it made 'antietam' and 'shiloh ' both very feeble is comparison. this is especially true for changing formations and artillery positions and the use of all enveloping red x's for visual targetting.",1

"you can download this program for a free day trial at the autodesk website. i have used autocad off and on myself since . i tried this version and i still prefer autocad . it's really hard to beat it for d capabilities. for bucks, i laugh at autodesk for still trying to make this kind of money off license upgrades. it definately has bells and whistles, but in today's economy, it's lacking in competive price, in spite of the fact that autodesk is sabotaging sales by releasing information on their own website that the lt versions in the near future will be released for free. if you only need d capable cad package, i would look toward other packages like intelicad or turbocad. maybe even try to get an old copy of autocad which would have some d capability. if you are wanting an elite cad package, you better go visit the bentley website for microstation. microstations raster capabilites totally blow away autocad products and imaging overlays are far superior to autodesk.",1

my daughter has had a lot of fun with this game. it is filled with lively cheerful music and adorable characters that she even likes to pretend to be when not on the computer sometimes. she was about / when we got it and it was just about right. it is mainly filled with letter recognition games in the form of matching. it is not a great brain teaser but it does give them an objective to work their way through. they have to find out who left their juice in the caboose through process of elimination. they get a clipboard with a passenger list that they can even print out along with a magnifying glass and a thinking hat. the final reward is slow in coming and it can lose their interest along the way. but it saves the game for you and you can spend days acheiving it if you like. they also make a video tape that mimics the game and is a great motivator to complete the game and see the ending.,1

"the new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. it may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. this version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. this is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. if microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. the new version does not run macros as fast however. my recommedation for existing users: keep office for as long as you can and consider going to open office when microsoft no longer supports (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of ).",1

"i admit, the game is very old, and blizzard has not only put out two sequels to this, as well as starcraft, but i still find myself playing this game, for nostalgia's sake.the thing is.. this game still hasn't gotten old for me. it's not hard to change the compatability, and by now the game is selling for so cheap that it can be worth the bucks to explore the origins of warcraft iii and starcraft. the game is pretty simplistic, in terms of gameplay and graphics, but it's still one of the most fun games you can get in my opinion.",1

"i played this game a few months ago, and i never got into it. i'm not really into sci/fi games in the first place, and it didn't help that the storyline was a little [off] if existent at all.the graphics were ok for its time and i enjoyed the idea of sneaking around guards, taking them out one by one, and the idea of hacking computers to get info and working the cameras(i'm a programmer what can i say). the sound and sound track lacked much to be desired.i had to make myself play it sometimes, because i always have to finish what i start, before i can move on to another game. half-life sucked this game out into space down a black hole. the only reason i gave it stars instead of was the graphics and the unique gameplay.after all is said and done it must have been a bad year for gamers for this to get a game of the year award.",0

"although this cd doesn't have any real problems, it also doesn't have any real points in its favor either. it has games that teach numbers, animals, etc., but my year old daughter doesn't find them fun enough to play on her own. maybe she's spoiled by some of the really excellent children's software available, but this cd did not elicit much enthusiasm.",1
"learn catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base; however, i have taken about years of spanish and found the cd to be fairly basic, and while catalan differs in many ways, many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope. there are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist. i definitely have benefitted from this cd because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it. overall, great for beginners, and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge.",1
"bought this product just before going to europe in june. don't know how we would have managed without it. we traveled by car to some fairly out of the way places, and used the software on our laptop with our gps to find our way. also used it to navigate on foot in cities, and to find hotels. there are some areas that have limited street information, which is why i gave it stars instead of , but overall a great product. one suggestion - set your route options so that the system chooses main roads and limited access roads for you unless you don't mind traveling on some small winding roads with room for only one car. breathtaking scenery, but a little worrisome when the road turns into a dirt path. if you are going to europe - buy this product.",1
"of all of the nancy drew games, i have to say this was one of the worst. i was expecting better since they have made so many games, but this one was horrible. i didn't really enjoy playing it like i did the others. if you are going to play a nancy drew game, don't chose this one!",0

"using the software and hardware included in this package i was able to connect my yamaha keyboard to my computer, and use the software to begin to learn to play the piano.teach me piano is an older software program (and it shows) that competently teaches piano playing. there are videos to show proper hand positions, exercises to teach you to play, and evaluations of your performance. while this is an older program, it works well on my more modern laptop and is quite good.one note, the cabling works as all standard midi cabling does; you plug the ""out"" cable into the ""in"" on the piano, and vice versa. if you plug the ""out"" into the ""out"" it won't work. i've heard people whine about this in reviews, but this has been part of the midi standard for decades and is just the way that it works.",1
"i bought my y/o son this. i was hoping for educational value. he for fun. most of the modules ened up being games, racing, building bridges, etc... without teaching anything more than how to manipulate a mouse. but even they are not so exciting. my son, who was so thrilled to get it, was bored in a day. the blue clue and reader rabbit software products are far better. it's a shame that the bbc let their name be attached to this disappointing product.",1

"the zoombinis was one of the first computer games to challenge users of any age to try math equations without any numbers. most people think that math means numbers. well this game shows those people that ingenius ideas like this can not only teach young children valuable learning skills, but might teach some children better than a math class would. the follow-up however, isnt as original as the first, and the fun factor drops a bit. that doesnt mean you cant enjoy this game. there are still instances where you will find yourself pulling your hair out in rage, but it just doesnt compare to the original. in terms of gameplay, replayability, and fun factor. sure, its much harder, but a hard game isnt worth playing if it doesnt have anything else to offer.",1

"i liked this game. the graphics were amazing, and the mystery was interesting. it was a bit more difficult than the last ones, and you could only use your cell phone to call bess and george when the game would allow. unlike the previous ones, where you could call whenever you needed a hint. they were never home this time until they wanted you to be able to call. even the camera in the phone was kinda useless, because after a few pictures it ran out of memory. i thought the mystery was a bit complicated to figure out, but it was very fun. overall, i liked the game. there were just a few things that i wasn't too crazy about.",1

"ordered my copy of turbotax basic on a sunday along with some other stuff. got the free shipping and it arrived on the following wednesday. thanks, amazon! i installed it in mid-january and applied the updates via the internet. it carried over the data from last year perfectly. some of my financial data was not available yet so i saved where i was.later in the month i entered the remaining data and an error that showed up in the final review. somehow the program rounded up the cents on my qualified dividends to the next dollar while total ordinary dividends were captured in dollars and cents. thus, in the comparison at final review, the qualified dividends exceeded total. while getting ready to complain to turbotax, i applied the one-step updates again and the problem was fixed (at the end of january).total time to complete my pretty complex return was about minutes (compared to the many hours i used to spend when doing my taxes manually years ago). i would highly recommend this product.",1
"for the most part finale songwriter was very good. the computerized instruments that allowed me to hear my music before i printed it was great. it was not completely the same as a real musician, but i know that will never be possible. the note placing on the staff was so easy and allowed me to write chords so much faster than by hand. many of the advanced techniques that i wanted to use such as grace notes were not there. i expected all finale products to have these features. i was severely disappointed when i found that these features were missing. it is very frustrating to me to purchase finale songwriter just to find out that i need to purchase the more advanced, more expensive finale.",1

"i have evaluated this product as an alternative to using the free microsoft foldershare service for syncronizing files & folders between my computers. i have found that there are some very restrictive limitations when configuring a file sharing workspace. more specifically, a file sharing workspace is limited to gb or , files, whichever comes first. once the limit is reached, the files in the workspace will no longer be synchronized.in these days of gb+ flash drives, having a gb file sharing limit is terribly restrictive. i have stopped using ms groove as a result and am currently looking for a better alternative to foldershare.",1
"i have bought roxio emc from amazon. i (try) use it to create dvd disk from digital high tapes; also use its drag disk feature.the software has the overall impression that it was made with dilbert's pointy hair boss in charge. it is loaded with features, video / audio editing and burning, label making etc, but unfortunatelly a lot of these modules are buggy. a few wrong keystroke and the system locks up, sometimes completely, requiring a hard boot. it also is so slow, perhaps because it was written in java, that it gives you the impression that you are not getting a response from your own computer but from another galaxy.there is few better competing products. if you bent on buying this product, do yourself a favor and buy it from roxio's web site, becasue from there you get a day money back guarantee - and there is a good chance you will want that guarantee.",1

"this program doesn't seem to be good for absolute beginners, but it's good for expanding your vocabulary. it took me a while working with other programs for learning chinese before i was ready to make good use of this one. dictionary part of it is awesome because you can see how the words are written in chinese characters as well as in pinyin. it has lots of fun games to test your comprehension and a lot of the material is focused on testing your knowledge of chinese characters.the program does teach some dialogues as well as grammar and it is helpful for making sure you're pronouncing the words correctly, but for me the greatest benefit of this program lies in helping one to learn lots of words and characters. you get to learn about words and characters and the best part about all of these words is that you get to hear them and you get to play with characters through lots of fun games. it really does help to retain the information.",1
"i have used microsoft dating back to first dos program. i own two companies with about plus computers between them. so i am the guinea pig on all new software.i have an extremely fast computer, with gig of ram, terabyte of fast hard drives on xp pro. i have built many computers. i only share this with you so you will see i am no novice.i cannot stress enough how slow my system is now when outlook is on. do a google search with ""outlook slow"" and you will see what i mean. i also agree with others about the so called ribbon approach. this all reminds me of when bmw introduce their infamous idrive. al their tech people thought it was revolutionary.what really happened was catastrophic to bmw. i was present when a customer came in the show room demanded their old bmw back or they would sue.you need to wait until they get this fixed and i recommend you make sure it is fixed. i cannot believe they released such a dog program.",1

"january . we used this in lisbon, madrid and barcelona in pedestrian mode, and on a hour drive in spain. it takes a lot longer to acquire satellites than it does in the us, and it had trouble getting them at all if there was not a clear view of the sky. when it does, it works well, though the maps do not include smaller streets and the maps are not up to date with some of the newer road construction. when it has a clear view of the satellites it is very accurate.overall, it was useful and gave good directions. i would recommend it if you dont mind supporting garmin's bottom line to the tune of $$$$.",1

"i have been using the ""free"" version of this software for years. it has become a critical component for all of the systems i work on. the pro version offers a little more functionality and features than the ""free"" version. it works beautifully in protecting your system. i would not recommend using a computer on the internet without it.the updated features for the pro version are: spyware protection and e-mail protection. it also monitors your installed virus protection to make sure its up to date. another nice feature is that it has identity data protection, which will protect your sensative information like credit card numbers.if you are unsure whether or not you need this program, check out their website and try the ""free"" version. the free version does not have any special ""extras"", but will help to demonstrate why its such a valuable program to have on your system. purchasing the pro version will unlock all of the features mentioned above. keep your system safe!",1

"we have a different version, i think, but the point is the same: it's great. this game taught my daughter how to use the mouse (without clicking) at months of age. at first she cried to play it all the time and that was difficult, but as soon as i realized she could do it by herself it has been fantastic. the fact that it doesn't require mouse clicks is crucial. we limit the amount of time she plays it each day so she doesn't become a computer junkie, but at least it is educational.(tip: set your screen resolution to x or x and turn your mouse speed way down using the control panel. the slower the mouse, the less control they need.)",1

"version . of premiere pro is much more stable than previous verions. its menus are intuitive and its features extensive. particularly strong are the ability to move back and forth with audition (for sound editing), encore (for dvd creation), after effects (for adding special effects and animations), and photoshop (for static picture editing). it is missing some features found in final cut pro (like being able to assign multiply, screen, overlay, lighten, etc. modes to clips), but if the video collection is purchased, there are easy workarounds using other software in the collection (like after effects). unlike avid xpress pro, it is pc only, so those who plan to share files with mac editors or who plan to upscale to a high end avid system - might look at xpress pro instead.its p support is more flawed than either vegas or xpress pro. hopefully this will be fixed with a patch in the near future.",1
"as my th version of wordperfect, this version keeps up the tradition well. i use ms-office at work and find myself transferring work to wordperfect to find and change codes. the greater compatibility of wp with ms-office helps considerably. also wp presentations is greatly improved and beats powerpoint for ease of use and graphic quality. preparing pdf and html files are other great features.",1

"my six-year-old daughter, who just started first grade, was completely engaged playing this game. it has a nice layout to explore, lots of activities, and it adapts to a range of skill levels. it was challenging enough to be interesting but not too hard to ""win"" and save the day for the city. i would give it five stars if only the arcade games were playable -- they were much too hard for my daughter. but she didn't seem to mind, since she really enjoyed everything else.",1
"this is good for people who like to build legos, but don't have the pieces, but has some significant downsides. the creation inevitably takes long and is fairly complex. it's difficult to get a good view of your creations with the tools provided. it's slow and choppy for outdated computers (mine's megahertz). on the plus side, this is realistic (compared to actually making a lego creation) and has some neat fun things (like dynamite). ultimately, i only recommend this for people who like to build and have a computer with at least megahertz.",1

i bought learn spanish now because of the favorable reviews but have been very disappointed for the following reasons:- no dictionary. i wanted to find the spanish meaning for some english words and discovered there was no such capability. you have to buy a separate product for that.- i wanted to learn some basic things like numbers and days of the week and could find no way to do that.- the lessons seem to be totally random - nothing builds on previous lessons and there seems to be very little organization to the material.this program is bad enough that it makes me question the objectivity of other reviews about this product. maybe it's time to shell out the cash and try the rosetta stone product.,1

it is hard to believe that this is version . of sonic mydvd. i say that because: how could you get to such a high version number and still have such a buggy product with such ugly menus? the only thing that you probably want this program to do is to make a menu for your dvd. unforturnately it is even bad at that. sometimes you can't change the labels under the buttons -- you click on the text in edit mode and nothing happens. the buttons are always stuck in the same place. often the button label (text) overlaps a button in a way that looks like an error. this also looks like a bug to me: if you try to change the label on the first chapter button the program also changes the menu title of the dvd. huh? you will waste hours of your time. even at this low price you should expect much better.,1
"...you can accept it ""as is"" with no hope of customer service.when the company was owned and operated in korea, customer service was great. when i was having a problem they even checked my web pages and told me what the problem was.

rosetta stone is a very efficient way to learn a language. i am an educator by profession and can recognize a well developed product in the field. you are presented with four pictures. you are also presented four written or spoken words in the chosen language. your task is to match the words with the pictures. the pictures are interesting so the entire process is like a game. i look forward to my daily session. the program is a bit expensive but i think it is money well spent - especially with the money back guarantee they provide.,1

"this is a very good software program. the only other program that comes close is legacy software. the improvements in the and releases are very helpful, including easier interaction with the web and websites. the software is heavy with advanced items, but still fairly basic for people who are just starting and don't want to get bogged down in the heavier, advanced capabilities. i especially like the connection to ancestry.com (can cost up to $ per month). this package gives you free use of their huge database for months. that makes the software almost free. the low review must be by a disgruntled ex-employee or a newbie to genealogy. his comments are way off base.",1

"ok, but my impression is that the lack of songs &amp; limited activies tends to place this software in the mediocre camp. on the plus side: one activity allows the child to simply use the left or right side of the key board to play. instructions or dialog can be skipped with a simple click of the mouse. the graphics are ok. has up to different levels. on the negative side: no songs! this is kind of lame for toddler ( - ) software. the clickable icons are also to small for some childern. as with almost all toddler software, childern are forced to do a lot of mouse clicking on small icons to play. i am only aware of &quot;reader rabbits toddler&quot;, having the foresight to eliminate this clicking problem. some of the activites were too quickly mastered. this software also has a few problems running with a touchscreen.",1

i bought this title to use during the summer prior to my child taking spanish in high school. she had little exposure to a foreign language and i wanted her to be ready when entering the class in high school. i found the cd to be a fun and simple way to introduce the basics of the language. both my child and i used the cd throughout the summer and were able to learn simple spanish techniques. the approach is simple and interesting. it presents the materials in small bites that are easy to understand followed by a testing period at &quot;la feria&quot; (the fair). you get to choose various activities to test how well you assimilated the material. my nd child is now using this cd to get prepared for his encounter with language. i would recommend this cd as an introduction and to help set some basics in place before taking an actual spanish course. it was more fun than either my children or i anticipated.,1

after you take the time to enter in all of your information you will wish that you didn't bother! the invitation list is not forgiving to change and the information can not be sorted to show up to best suit what you need. i do not recomend this software to anyone. . .unless you want your headache even bigger!,1
"i currently use quickbooks pro . it's a good program overall. however, when you come across a problem that you can't solve, get out your credit card. you'll either have to pay intuit ($) per year for a support contract or ($) plus ($) per minute for calls over minutes. i have diligently searched through the help menu, online knowledge base, message boards, and fax-on-demand, and i still have not found the answers to different problems. i guess i was naive to think they would provide all the answers for free when they can make more money on support contracts.",1

"this program is has been working very well for me. though it is level , it does help if you have previous experience with the korean language or at least some supplemental materials. there are no lessons for leaning the hangul, the korean writing system. it helps greatly if you already know this before hand.learning vocabulary and basic grammatical patterns goes quickly because of the rosetta stone method of learning intuitively. this program is great for learning a language as long as it is supplement with other materials.",1

"after having used another piece of home design software, i found this product to be much more user-friendly. simply put, it is a fun program to play around with, to get some rough ideas. after all, look at the price. this is not intended to be professional calibre software. but for dabbling in home design, it would be difficult to find an program that is easier to use. if the day ever comes that i want a house built, i will be using this software to &quot;sketch&quot; my ideas to take to an architect.",1

i found this product easy to install. after installation a handy enable/disable icon appears on your control strip. you are allowed some customizing of operation and a log of access attempts is kept. of course this product integrates well with other symantec products (ie. systemworks). overall if you are a home user running other norton software this probably is the way to go. if you want a stand alone product it might be worth making a comparrison with open door networks &quot;door stop&quot;.,1

"this program is great...at first, then you get lured into it and the bugs keep getting more and more annoying until you are forced to upgrade. we started using the payroll service a few years ago and now to change would be a big nightmare, so we pay every year for upgrades and tech support for all the little &quot;bugs&quot; they put in the program. it seems that at about a year the &quot;bugs&quot; get really annoying and the program itself keeps prompting you to upgrade, asking if you need improved performance and such, which you do because i think they program it to get more sluggish so you upgrade and you are stuck. if you don't want to pay forever and ever, stay away from quickboooks.",1
"my three kids, ages , , all liked this software. they liked playing the games before they got all the clues. there are lots of interesting click points. the birthday card activity was really neat. my only complaint is that going from one room to another is slow and some of the clues seem hard to find. overall all though, a good buy, wholesome and entertaining.",1

"the product basically does what it's supposed to, but it makes assumptions about things (like whether you want to make estimated payments for next year or not) and it's very difficult to change these back. you shouldn't have to fight with your software. also, it imported charities from the previous year that i didn't donate to this year, and removing these was difficult. finally, customer support has apparently been moved out of the country. the response i received from email was clearly from someone who didn't have native level english ability and absolutely failed to answer the actual question (gave a stock answer that was irrelevant). the automated online support also has very limited options. if turbotax is in fact the best tax prep software out there, i may have to go back to doing it by hand next year. in short, don't bother with the program if your taxes are easy, and, from reading the other reviews, don't trust it if your taxes are complex, either.",1

i just returned from a mile trip using the s/t . i too had a little trouble with the activation as i was not near wifi most of the time but once i got a good connections it worked.in general it worked well. i did laugh when a huge lake in bc did not show up on one side of the road i was traveling beside. it is hard to read a lot of the small type in the car. looking for the different colors of the minuscule blocks to see which was a restaurant and which was a bank was a problem. gps reception can be spotty even when it appears it should be ok. on one or two occasions it did confuse left and right but the map was there to confirm.all in all though it bailed me several times when i had know idea where i was in rural bc. it also got me through vancouver and seattle with no hassles. i also love being able to save my trip plans and reuse them again.,1

"if you have a child that loves dora and you have [amount] to spend, go for it. otherwise, steer clear. here are my reasons:*there is not much replay value in the game. it is the same set of tasks to perform each time you play and they always come in the same order.*there is not a large variety of things to do (discovery airport was the same price and it seems to have a lot more to do).*the tasks that are performed do not seem have much educational value when compared to other software like the jumpstart line.*the product seems like it was put together quickly so it could be rushed to market in order to capitalize on dora's popularity.having said all of this, i will admit that the graphics are nice. it does look like the show.",1

"as a new mac convert ( year on a macbook) i was actually eagerly looking forward to leopard largely for time machine - to easily and simply manage backups for our family's macs.sadly, apple stripped out the most important network backup functionality from time machine just before retail release and further ... i (and frankly many others) have found curious disk compatibility issues with leopard and time machine that are reproducible and worrisome. i have several usb disks that i attempted to use with time machine (even after extensive reading of apple's support forums) that are corrupted and unusable after the attempt to use with time machine.i remain unsuccessful in getting time machine to reliably work.the other features of leopard are nice, but few are really compelling other than time machine.i would wait as apple should have done .. until this product is really ready for end users.",0
"thomas, his friends, and the island of sodor look absolutely fantastic in this game's high quality -d graphics. the stereo sound effects are also top-notch. (in fact, graphics and sound are probably much better than they really needed to be for a preschool-age game!) on the downside, the game itself is a bit lacking in terms of things to do, especially for older preschoolers. the activities range from the super-easy (i.e. click on the sponge and then wipe the dirt off thomas) to the mildly challenging (i.e. put the large rock in the large freight car, the medium-sized rock in the medium-sized car, etc). there aren't a lot of activities, and they don't change with repeated playings. it's probably a great game for kids brand new to the computer and/or for thomas fans, but more experienced computer-kids will lose interest after a couple of rounds.",1
"this is a powerful piece of software to both organize your digital photos and to manipulate the images. i know that standard photoshop has more features, but it is difficult to imagine the non professional would ever need more than what is in this program.i had been using microsoft digital image pro . i bought this because it had the photo organizer feature. i really like the ability to organize photos with the same program i use for image manipulation.i won't repeat the list of features as discussed in the other reviews, but i will say that the documentation that came with this is marginal, and the help feature is not user friendly.the microsoft digital image pro was much easier to use out of the box, and had better documentation. it can't do as much, but is certainly adequate for the majority of amateur photographers. if you want an adequate, easier program, consider digital image pro .if you decide to purchase photoshop elements, i would suggest getting a companion book with it.",1
"purchased program at full cost. identified flaw and after trying to correct it myself, i called technical support. they acknowledged that the bug that i identified (not able to use numbers)had been identified as a problem on some other discs. instead of sending me a debugged disc, they wasted hours making me retrain another user x . they were supposed to have me send files so that they could analyze them, the files were never sent . program often crashes computer. instead of trying to help technical support was wasting hours of my time trying to figure out the bugs, i am very angry about their rudeness and insensitivity. i still have not had the problem resolved and have lost countless hours of productivity.",1
"i agree, this software is good. great detail. the d feature is over-rated, though, for my uses. more of an image gimmick than actual representation of terrain. more importantly, though, my software suddenly &quot;lost&quot; one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. i also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. result: no fix. the company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians.",1
