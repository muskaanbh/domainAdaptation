"the equus reader does a great job of reading the code for my escape, but doesn't offer any diagnostic information on how the code can be fixed. still have to take it to the dealer in order to fix the problem. the code can be erased/reset in order to shut off the engine light on certain code errors, but that still doesn't fix the overall problem, nor give any ideas to the owner of how to fix the problem. i'm a little disappointed.",0
i purchased this to put on top of my car's leather seat for comfort and protection of the leather. this is not for cars with leather seats. by the time i sat in the car the cushion had shifted to the point of being uncomfortable. it simply would not stay in place. the strap that goes over the back of the seat slid all the way down and the other two straps for the bottom of the seat were useless. i got so fed up i ended up tossing it in the back seat and now my dog seems to love it!,1
i wasn't very pleased with this product overall. i was expecting some nice alluminum/metal wire separators and instead these are cheap plastic separators. putting them on isn't the easiest because the bolt tries to fall out whenever you go to put them on. i didn't even bother to leave them on for this reason. i found a parts car and took some of the factory wire separators off of it for my ' supra.,1
"i used these for a cross contry motorcycle trip about miles long (one way). before i got them i had times where the unusual wind currents were making it hard to see, my eyes were weeping so badly. while using them, i had no problems. in fact the smoked lens was very appreciated when i was up in the high mountains at midday. at first they were uncomfortable until i learned that i needed to push my glasses into the goggles before putting them on. otherwise they put pressure on my glasses and got real unconfortable- i could have gone without the headache and it doesn't mention in the instructions about how to set things up so the goggles don't put pressure on the glasses. when on correctly they did everything i expected them to do. thumbs up!",1
"you would think as long as they have been making this hitch, they could get the spacing on the bolts correct. i put it on myself and didn't raise the car up. it isn't real easy, i used my foot to hold up the other end while i bolted it in. i had to take it down because the holes didn't line up and hit it with a sledge hammer. i had to do this a couple of times to get it right.have someone help you, and don't do it when it's deg's like i did.",1
"measure your steering wheel before you buy this product. it is said to fit up to ."" diameter, but that is not true. my wheel is ."" and i spent a very long time with more than one person trying to fit it on my wheel. it never fit. i think it would even be hard to get on a "" wheel. it is made well and the insulation would probably work, but they need to be more honest about the size of wheel it would fit. it seemed like my wheel would have to be at least an inch smaller.",1
i had a good experience with this vendor and product. i would purchase again if still available. product was received in a timely manner,0
"big and heavy, but built for a lot of continuous use - plenty of ventilation and the case and sockets that come with it are perfect and built well.air wrenches are the way to go if you are looking for precision, though. with this electric and any other one, you need to finish off your job with a torque wrench.",1
my kit did not come with a cord to hook up to my computer. to download the dtc codes. i would like to have one sent to me as the unit was new and it should have every hook up especially the cord to hook up the pc to the unit thanks dennis,0
"not enough time has passed to rate durability, but ease of applying is great, and no residue to speak of is very nice. shine looks great.",0
"it seems to work well for sealing leaks. i used it in my basement to coat areas where tiny cracks in the walls had appeared during previous rainstorms. one coat tackled all of the areas i was worried about. the next day, it rained. the corner- previously the leakiest spot- was bone dry. other spots had a tiny amount of water. in total, only a couple of tablespoons of water got through, versus the usual amount which can be anywhere from - gallons. yesterday, we got an even bigger storm and there was no further leakage. it took me cans to do coat. each can covered a good amount of space.i'm ordering more so that i can do a second coat, just to be on the safe side. this stuff works better than the special sealant paint from the hardware store.",1
"great coupler lock, great value, however no size is listed in the product description and, regrettably, it was too small and would not fit my ' boat trailer with an approximate -/"" wide coupler. for security reasons, i liked the fact that this lock has a tubular locking mechanism, versus a convention flat key system, which is easier to pick. learned, after the fact, that you have a better chance of having the coupler lock fit your trailer if it is described as ""universal."" i compromised and re-selected a master dat universal trailer coupler lock, which had great reviews, but a flat key locking mechanism. still, if you have a smaller "" hitch ball, this is a great coupler lock and terrific value!",1
"this works like it's supposed to. holds my without issue. a few notes though:) get your own mounting screws, the stuff that comes with it is junk) i ended up putting up x supports and mounting everything to those. i didn't put the middle support in, and it doesn't seem to matter.) my ceiling is is just over ' tall, and this only comes down to about eye-level for me (i'm ' tall). it's enough for me, but you might consider getting a longer rope.",1

i purchased this pump to replace a wellbro unit that had failed on my ' pontiac. the wellbro was noisy and difficult to install. the carter is quiet and came with everything i needed to get it in and pumping. a great unit for the price.,1
"worked fine, simple to use, although not perfectly intuitive - i had to look up in the manual to realize that you had to hold down the erase key for awhile to activate it. also had to refer to the manual to find out that you had to turn the car key to the on position for it to work. they could have printed this info on the device to make it easier...buying this for $ saved me a ""$"" repair that the shop fraudulently claimed was needed!recommended.",1
"after installing this kit on my dodge ram (.l v), i noticed immediate gains in acceleration and gas mileage (from to mpg hwy), topped off my a nice throaty growl!!! well worth the money, and not that difficult to install, even for a shade-tree mechanic like myself. recommended!",1
it just bought this mp player about a month ago and just recently there has been a problem. for some reason i cant change the volume not a big deal but at the same time it is. if anyone can figure it out your input would be nice but other than this problem this mp player is great.,0
i returned this item over weeks ago and have not been received reimbursement? plezse respond and update me on reimbursement? thank you!,0
"i'm using the tender to keep the batteries in my boat, that is on its trailer next to my house, up to full charge throughout the winter. one battery is a water filled type with high cranking amps used to start the v, hp engine and the other battery is a sealed gell, deep-cycle for running the ""house"" electronics. the charging requirements are different for each battery and i was assured by the manufacturer that this charger/tender could meet the specific needs of both types without a problem. i installed the tender and within hrs. both batteries were fully charged and in maintenance mode. keeping the batteries fully charged through the winter should extend their usefull life and have me ""good-to-go"" in the spring. i'm very pleased so far with the performance and cost of this product.",1
"the power leads supplied are short, and the location for connecting them to the inverter is too low to allow the terminals to clear a shelf or any flat surface, so the unit must hang over an edge or the terminals bent, or turned sideways.",1
"there is a little metal tooth thing inside this monkey that looks like it wants you to touch it, but if you pry the top off with a wrench and stick body parts in there to touch it, you better be grounded buddy because you're in for the ride of your life. this thing must have a jiggawatt capacitor in there or something because i blacked out and didn't wake up for hours after touching it, and it wasn't even plugged in at the time. i can't stop blinking lately either. be careful when dissecting this little tazer-wannabe!!!",0
"i recently purchased this mattress for a three year old, and am very pleased with the speed of shipping and the quality of product. it is a perfect first mattress, but it is a wonder as to how they were able to send it in such a small box. care should be used in opening due to the vacuum packing, and that massive inrush of air.",1
"although i have not had a need to record on this product, i'm sure that because of the name it will be ok. one aspect of ordering on amazon.com with free delivery.....that usually means slow delivery....so, if your not in a rush, and you can wait, it's worth saving a few extra $$$$.",0
"i have an ' polaris sportsman , which by itself is not a slow machine. once i added this filter as a replacement for the original, however, it was a whole different ballgame. i immediately notice the boost to acceleration and pickup from the motor, and as someone who rides mostly off-road in the desert i'm sure i'm adding longevity to the bike as well. simple install; fits directly in place of the stock filter. a very inexpensive way to grab a few more horses.",1
"i have a ford explorer with , mi. the check engine light indicated a catalytic converter issue. i ultimately used cans and drove about highway miles in days and the light went out and has stayed out for a couple of months now - pretty cheap solution.",1

"i have been using two of these in my garage for over a year and find them to be very helpful in finding that just-right spot to conserve space. the only problem i have had is that they have a tendency to scoot a little over time. so if you are depending on them to remain in place be careful. once you find the sweet spot take a sharpey pen and mark each corner so you can adjust them from time to time. overall, it is a good product.",1
"the power dome being the most expensive portable power i've purchased comparing to the ones sold at checker auto, it has a longer lasting battery than most. unfortunately, they still use the cheap plastic clamps that's already broken which i ended up replacing them with metal battery clamps. the cheap one sold at checker auto did the same thing. they should have put the metal clamps on in the first place. average.",1
"the main pro of this product is that it looks real enough. i wouldn't place it directly in view for a would-be robber to see because the person could tell it's not connected to the car's electrical system in any way (and is therefore fake). thankfully my radio has been stolen already so i was able to place it inside where the hole is, just showing, and it looks like it could be attached to something.the con is the thing is garbage. yes it is cheaply made, it's just alternates flashing lights. the battery life on this thing is ridiculous. lasts about - days, roughly - hours per day on aaa batteries. not exactly what i was looking for. oh well.",1
this is a fun game to play with others. i played it a lot with my niece and nephew. it is a good family type game if your kids have a bit of coordination because you have to work together to accomplish things.,0
"amazon needs to update their photo file on this product!!!! it is misleading to put a picture of a dispenser & hand cleaner combo, then only send out the dispenser!!!! as far as the product goes, the dispenser is star quality, but amazon missed the boat on this one!!!! change your damn picture!!!!!",0

this works fine - got it in the time promised. the only difficulty is that there is not much of an instruction manual.,1
"it wasn't clear by the description that you were unable to use the inflator while plugged in. however, it performed more than adequately with a full charge. note: you can use the car adaptor in a power emergency - when the battery is almost fully discharged.",1
"this product suck for vehicles with larger tires. riding over the first bump is ok, but i am always afraid that the vehicle will also run over the second one since the size is not much larger. if you are not careful you could give it too much gas and then risk driving over the second bump. this can cause damage to your vehicle or garage.",0

"i've never had to use it --hope i never will. it's very small which concerns me if i ever had to use it as intended to knock out the car window, i'm not sure it would do it. i can always use my fist, right?the embedded blade is fine --it should cut through seat belts with no problem. the little black cap at the top is spring loaded & supposed to generate enough force to break tempered glass --not sure but also not willing to test it out. happy the glass man is rich enough!its small enough to fit on your key chain w/out being too obtrusive, i hang mine from the rear view mirror so it's handy should the need arise.i've seen the full size version & may pick one up as i would feel much more confident in it.",0
"wow i thought thule was the company for this type of stuff. boy was i mad after a trip from nj to sc. the bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected). but when i got to sc and opened the bag....the horror! the inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything! there were also holes along the to seam! what a mess...and i couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home! i just wrote thule....we'll see if they come thru for the customersept. , thule sent me a replacement, an escape . great customer service....but does this mean the escape is better? is the quest inferior? there was no coorespondence with the repalcement...i'll try it out this summer.",1
"i bought this series of products based on the recommendation of a local person i hired to patch my friend's leather car seat. he told me that my chair in the house was not leather and reccommended this product to clean it. i'm glad i tried it in a small obscure spot as recommended, as it took the color out of the spot i tested. my chair is indeed leather i think and this is not the right product. i have tried it on other vinyl products with the same result. perhaps you will have better luck than i did. i won't be purchasing any more of these products by this brand name. live and learn.",0

i would not buy this product again. it does what it should but if i had to do it again i would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from viking/cobra.,0
this was the best thing i ever bought for camping. my husband thought i was crazy but when we woke up in the morning and we did not have to walk a half a mile to the bathroom he was thanking me for buying it. everyone should have one.,1
"i've been running this battery for over years in a cold climate in my subaru wrx (. l flat ) without issue. the starter has started to sound a little weak on colder mornings, though so i just picked up a new one.one thing to note, this battery does not come with the posts (terminals) in the picture. shame on you amazon. show a picture of what you sell. the posts are available for around $. also, the battery is cheaper at the website i ordered the first pc from, [...]. i should have checked there first. i would have saved over $.",1
"this tool probably has some value for those instances when the impact required to remove a stubborn screw is not so demanding. but, i found it totally useless to remove a screw securing my audi tt brake rotor. because this is basically a broad handled screwdriver, the unit cannot be held solidly when striking the end. it automatically turns in your hand as it tries to loosen the screw. but, it is heavy. it'll make a nice boat anchor.",0
"unfortunately, this product did not work for me as advertised. i purchased it after reading many reviews, but in those other reviews, the people were talking about something specific: certain chemicals that it was supposed to contain, chemicals that made it what it was. without them, it was just like chevron gas. as i take care of my car, this did absolutely nothing for me, unlike the seafoam that i used on my engine, so i would recommend to anyone who is reading this to use seafoam if you get the chance, and read some guides on it. it is not only fun, but also a great cleansing agent.",0
"i attempted to use this mixer with lb bags of cement to use with quikcrete walk maker molds. lbs is really just too much for it to handle. it did eventually mix it, but after all the work to roll it and the need to clean the mixer periodically, i found it more effective to just go back to the wheelbarrow and hoe.i wont be getting rid f it just yet though. it is a great idea and effective for smaller batches, just not what i needed it for,",1
"you need sets of these `yakima q clip sets' and the corresponding `yakima roundbars roof rack cross bars' (check your vehicle dimensions for the proper lengths), if you are planning to install a ski rack or any type of enclosure unit. i had these installed professionally for a little bit more money, and it was worth avoiding the hassle. they come with an extra set of keys and are very strong. they are simple and sleek. definitely a `must have' for a truck owner.",1
"feel like the baddest man in town with this tasty new treat from pilot. nostradamus weekly has predicted that skull shift knobs are going to be the next big fad to hit the states, so i advise you to buy at least a case so your friends don't miss out. i've already bought amazon.com out, you'll have to prowl the net to get your hands on these.",0
"i bought this shocks for my wife's grand marquis, which had monroe on it. what a difference they made in ride quality! now the car rides luxurious like it should and not like a boat with the monroe shocks. also has a little better handling. depending on the application (which in my case it worked!) this shocks are a good buy!",1

"we just purchased the pt-aeu on // and spent a lot of time evaluating this projector. what we found: the unit is attractive in appearance and has a nice menu selection for adjustments. setup was simple and easy. we tried s-video, pc input, and finally the hdmi cable. there is a difference in quality from s-video and hdmi, so i recommend you use the hdmi. colors are ok, not bad but not outstanding. i was very critical on the optics and expected better clarity in focus and sharpness but for $ the quality is ok, not bad but not excellent. we are using a delite video spectra .

very cheap. materials are cheap and very flimsy. would not recommend it for fuel. reminds me of the giant pixy stix powder candy.,0

"some agm batteries specified charging voltage of no more than .v, but this charger will go up to .v, and it stays at .v for about % of the maintenance mode pulses.this is way too overvoltage and could damage your battery, shorten the lifetime of it. i found it out the hard way.protect your agm battery, be careful when you choose your charger, just because they ""said"" it's for agm , doesn't mean it's always % fool proof.",1
"cyrus chestnut is a wonderful young talent and this cd showcases him terrifically. i strongly disagree with a previous reviewer that this is even close to easy listening. first, cyrus plays extremely aggressively. without ever losing his touch he bangs the heck out of the keyboard on some selections. this is, after all a trio (which is joined by a saxophonist on three songs that all work). the trio is a classic jazz lineup and sometimes, it is exactly what you want to hear. this cd rewards on the first listening and is still pleasing me!",0
"the sound is almost all mushy bass, lacking any clarity, definition and midrange. i've heard better units costing half as much. never again.",0
"the blade itself works well, but the handle isn't designed well for traditional ice scraping. i created a new start-up company during a recent snow storm, we remove excess snow and ice from roofs, driveways, and sidewalks.knowing shovels would not be adequate, i purchased icedozers in hope for more efficient workmen. i came to realize my men were coming to work with sore backs, blistered hands and shattered egos. my start up is now losing money because of this faulty product, it should really only be recommended for small houses.if you still wish to try your luck with this product, there is a modification that can increase your productivity. i found that taping/gluing a broom handle to the icedozer will allow you more leverage while while scraping. none the less, be sure to know an accurate square footage estimate of the property you will be working on. i would not use this on a house larger than , square feet, or , if you are using the broom handle modification.",0
"despite the title, rack mount hardware is not included or available. you can lay it flat on a shelf and it's u high: sort of a poor-man's rackmount.",0
"this arrived in a box that had been previously opened and re-taped as well as squashed. the product looks to be very stable and well made. it would be nice to see some detailed pictures or a description as to what the various attgachments are for and how to use them.i read the directions and it's hard to figure out what's to be used for what.frankly i'm a bit dissapointed in amazon regarding this product. i will try to assemble and figure out. if not, it's going back!",0
"i got this at a brick-and-mortar store for pretty much this price. i was surprised at how accurate it was considering the price. it does require some coordination to get it sealed properly, but it's not that difficult.the main problem that spurred me to give this review is the fact that i tried to use it yesterday after several months without touching it and got a low battery indicator. i haven't even had it for a year, and only used it a few times! from what i remember, the packaging (long thrown-away) says the battery is not user-replaceable.i'd rather get something a bit more expensive but that will last.",1
i bought a pair of these bosch wiper blades for my ford fusion and they are pretty much shot at months. this blade leaves streaks and smears on most of the driver's side which i think is due to the length of this blade. this happens even though i clean the windshield and blades often. the shorter passenger side seems to wipe better but is still not great. the driver's side blade has now developed a nick in the blade resulting in a bead of water that is never removed from my field of vision. i actully put the original blades back on and they perform better than the bosch blades ever did. i recommend not buying these blades.,1
"overall a good product. heats quickly and very comfortable.only drawback is the straps are basically useless,too short and weak. you will need to find a way to secure the cushion.i would buy again.",1
"this was not why i expected. i thought it would be an easy gadget, but it was not. it doesn't even have an on/off button. the turntable never worked. the instructions suggest what u need to do should the turntable not spin. i didn't even try it, just a waste of time. amazon's return policy makes it so easy to return the item back that i have no regrets on getting it as long as it was from amazon.",0
i bought this set and they look nothing like the picture. they are a chrome color with no gray variations. they are vaper guns not titan i dont know where they got that from.prosi oredered these sprayers on sat and got them tues great fast delivery. looks like they are good quality.,0
"this is a nice product, that sells itself on not needing to look up codes. however, they do not make it very clear, that this feature only works for ford, gm, chrysler and toyota. if you have any other car, do not spend the extra money. get the less expensive unit, since you will have to go on the web to look up the code definitions anyway.",1
the battery is ok and will probably work fine for years but it is expensive. i did not see the compatibles when i purchased this item or i would have saved a lot of money.,0
"this item is not compatible with a cigarette lighter. i bought one and it came with two connectors to attach directly to the terminals on a car battery. the instruction manual specifically states that the unit cannot be powered by a cigarette lighter, but the smaller and models can.",1
"i give points as i cannot access my video footage to comment on quality. the camera is easy to record. it is like all other camcorders. the print on the camera is very difficult to read even with glasses. i am no technopeasant by any means. i have read and reread the instructions. i can not get the camera to rewind or playback. i called jvc. yesterday i was on hold for min. when a female picks up the phone, says, i think! call back tomorrow and slammed the phone down. i tried for hours today to get through, even to get through to an operator. no luck, jvc sucks. customer service is the nd biggest consideration you should take once you decide to buy an expensive product. without the customer service how can we get operation information when help is needed . think about it! won't you!",0
"purchased these to protect our flooring in our rav and i am seriously impressed with the fit. the liners look as though they are built into the vehicle and the fit is very impressive.we purchased the front, rear and cargo liners and all of them are durable, well-fit and a wonderful addition to the vehicle.a word of advice though: the driver side liner comes with floor hooks that look very similar to those of the rav but the hook included is a tad higher with a somewhat more aggressive looking hook....use this hook and save yourself the trouble of installing the liner twice or having it slip around. the added thickness and contour of the liner requires that you use the included hooks.",1
"i bought one of these at walmart for around $ when i couldn't find my no-name inverters. this one has worked great, i take it on every plane trip i go on. normally i use this to power my laptop ($ for an inverter is better than - for a laptop-specific dc power adapter, if you can even find one). one time when the battery was low, the inverter kept shutting itself off. it would work for a few seconds, then quit until i unplugged + plugged it back in. my theory is that when the laptop battery was extremely low, the power adapter was drawing more wattage than this little inverter could handle. other than that one time, i've had no problems. has a little fan noise, normally not noticeable. definitely recommended, nicer (better built) than the no-name inverters i've tried.",1
"i cannot tell how well this will work until the power goes out, so far so good. i assume it will be fine as we have used these before with good results.",0

"i bought these off of tire rack for $ plus shipping. $ total. rip off. i had dot approved $ lights that outshined these expensive bulbs by a wide margin. the low beams are a nice color of white. not purple/blue. plus, it is not very bright. not as bright as my old cheap bulbs. the high beams are also white, not blue at all. i was really excited about these ""high performance"" bulbs, but it was all hype. packaging, marketing, high price, make them seem ""better"" than the rest. they don't look anything like real hid's. anyone who would confuse the two must be blind, or just retarded. do not buy. you have been warned.",1

"purchased pairs of these ton jacks from amazon. they look pretty solid, i have not had a chance to use them yet so i gave it stars. i'm sure it will hold up both ends of my honda crv perfectly. i will use for minor repairs, brakes, tire rotation, etc.",0
igloo has free shipping but the front is faux metal (silver plastic). if i had to do it over again i'd get the emerson (stainless front)emerson -bottle wine cooler - stainless steel-- $ shipping to nj. also the temp indicator is off; setting the unit to degrees yields degree wine --actron cp pockettherm infrared thermometer. i believe the pockettherm to be correct as it determined ice water to be / degrees.,0
"when i received the product, i was disappointed in the fabric it is made of. it is basically plastic over cardboard. none the less, i purchased, might as well use it. it is very convenient to have in the front seat. it is difficult to place or remove bottled water from the mesh pocket, i usually perform this at a red light. it does fit a standard manila size folder in the back pocket. the handles are great, the when loaded, this thing is fragile! in trying to rotate it for the first time, the driver side handles began to rip. my advice, either load it lightly or be mindful to support the bottom when rotating.",1
"works just like promised, so it's exactly what i need, but the first time i used it i turned off my car (which can normally power things while off), and proceeded to blow a fuse. just keep the car running and it works perfectly.",1
"this unit is a reliable beast. i suspect that direct buyers (no local dealer) might have difficulties getting their generator to peak perform, right off the pallet. this unit generally requires some fine tuning to run smoothly, and if you are not mechanically adept, buy a smaller unit with a honda. the generac motor has been around for a long time, and is a very reliable (as in better than the riding mower engines) power plant. it does need to be tuned to run with the demand. it has a controlled idle that jumps around a bit as your electrical load varies, but is normal. if you are not a tweaker, get the honda. (see above.) i converted my unit to tri-fuel, and use on natural gas. paid $ for the beast and about $ for the conversion kit. all copper windings, made in wisconsin. buy american when you can.",1

"it's a nice looking helmet, and aside from the chinstrap, it fits well too. i read a review before i bought the helmet, and i agree w/ that review. the chin strap is in the wrong place, so it's more of a choker, than anything else. additionally, at highway speeds, chinstrap will loosen up, and the helmet will try to slide off; trying to readjust the chinstrap is near impossible. then the quick release on the chinstrap is unreliable; it holds securely when riding, you don't have to worry about that, but when you try to remove the helmet, maybe the quick release will release, maybe it won't.in the end, the only problem with the helmet is the chinstrap, but there are problems that i've had with the chinstrap, and unless the manufacturer can correct those deficiencies, your money is better spent on a different product.mike",1
"it's alright. i wish it would heat up faster. however, even when it isn't heating at all, the material feels warmer to my bum on a cold morning than the actual car seat, so there's a plus. i hate how poorly it stays in place. it should have a rubberized or sticky backside so i wouldn't have to battle each time i get into the car to avoid it sliding over. yes it has straps, but they are weak.",1

"overall, the product appears to be well built and sturdy. it took about an hour to assemble by myself. with help, it could easily be done in less than an hour. my only complaint is that the photo is misleading in two respects. first, it does not come with side rails. fortunately, i read an earlier review which noted that fact and was not surprised when it did not come with the side rails. second, the photos make it appear as if the carrier sits close to the bumper of your vehicle. that is not the case. in fact, this carrier sits out about twenty inches from the bumper of your vehicle. my guess is that it has to do with the hinge that allows the carrier to fold up. in any event, if i had any idea that it stuck out that far, i would have opted for the non-folding variety. but, other than that, the product appears to be sturdy and suitable for its purpose.",1

what i saw in the picture is not what i got. mine is all black and has much longer valve tube.this is a h-u-g-e gauge and more suitable for home use than carrying along on the road. very good valve stem fitment and it rotates too. dial has somewhat cheesy plastic feel but does show accurate pressure (makes me realize my trusted little portable accutire gauge is in fact off by psi.) bleed valve is a nice feature but don't expect a precision feel. four stars!,1

"this protective filter is a necessity for an expensive lens so why don't they make it part of the lens purchase? because they know we will have to purchase it anyway and that is more dollars in their till. so so ... no biggee. amazon did their job well. merchant did their job well. i just wish manufacturers would quit charging an arm and a leg for a mass produced ""in china"" items that should be included in the price of the item.",0

"i bought this tow bar to haul a jeep wrangler behind our motor home.the price/quality equation is about right. the bar performs well and does what it's supposed to do, but it lacks the features of high-end bars made by other manufacturers (e.g. storage on the motor home, only having to get the tow vehicle 'close' to the bar to complete hookup, etc.). additionally, the kit doesn't include safety chains (although the bar has mounts for them). a trip to the local wal-mart solves that issue.given this towing solution costs hundreds of dollars less than a higher-end one, i'll put up with the minor inconveniences encountered while hooking up/unhooking. overall an economical way to tow flat-bumpered cars.",1

don't attempt to install unless you have prior experience with electrical systems. after spending several hours trying to figure out the installation i gave up and went to cry toys. they had it installed in a couple of hours w/o any problems. works very well in my f superduty (w/diesel). there is a defect in the design of the remote that makes it break easily away from the key ring. mine lasted less than a month and i am having a difficult time locating a replacement at a reasonable price.,1
before we moved into a house we lived in an apartment with a poorly-maintained a/c. it also didn't help that for a day or two it seems the filter wasn't in its proper place and so a lot of dirt/dust made it's way to the coils indoors. a couple of treatments with this foam seem to make the difference between marginal performance and almost normal performance of our a/c system.,1

"so far the only thing we have found this good for is if you leave your lights on. we purchased of these. one of the cars we have one in, the van is having problems with a short in the electrical system and chrysler dodge is not able to find where the problem is. so we purchased this so my elderly mother could just plug this in and jump the car. it doesn't work. so we have to go across town, hook the jumper cables up and start the car then disconnect the cables. you would think that this would work for that. it just needs that little bit of a jump, but it won't.so i'm very disappointed in that.i'm waiting to be able to use the two when they actually will work for me.",1
"i've learned from my mistakes. i've purchased two of the cheaper jump starters (one coleman, one vector, probably made by the same folks) and both stank. they don't give enough power to do than more than a couple of cranks in warm weather, and are worse in the cold. worst of all, the cheap plastic clamps broke. it was difficult to open them wide enough.this charger, on the other hand, works very well, and it's a great value. lots more power, charges up efficiently, and has solid all metal clamps. you do need an extension cord with a small enough female end to charge it, but that's easily found.btw, aside from the obvious uses of this product, it's nice to have the male-to-male cigarette lighter extension cord. this allows you to provide power to your vehicle when you are swapping out that dead battery that was giving your problems, which means that all the electronic settings in your vehicle are preserved during the swap.",1
"i didn't expect much out of these racks, but to my surprise they worked extremely well. i used them with both one and two short boards doing freeway driving (at speeds i'd rather not admit to) and this thing worked like a charm. only once over several hundred miles of driving did one of the straps start to come lose and vibrate. a second retighten and we were back on our way.a couple of things to note:. if you have a wider board, the metal buckles might sit on the rails. might be a good idea to use a board bag or have some padding you can put between the board and the buckles.. i put some anti-slip rug material between the straps and the board. this seemed to keep the straps from vibrating and creating a ruckus. plus i felt better about the boards not sliding around.",1
"i bought this stuff for my willys jeep. the transfer case/transmission has developed a nasty leak recently, and i hoped this product would help. i added a full bottle to the transfer case (which was leaking the most) and a bit to the transmission sump; they are interconnected, but have separate fill and drain holes. it was very difficult to get into the fill holes because of the viscosity of the stuff (about the consistency of molasses). i drove around today, about miles or so, and both the transfer case and the transmission still leak about the same as when i put it in. i cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission.",0

"the bosch evolution wiper blade performs excellent. the wiper maintains full contact through the harshest downpours, and won't clog up with ice. it is easy to install, features quiet operation, and looks great. the downside of this wiper is definately the price, and it is designed to stay that way! the rubber insert (which is the only part that wears out)can't be replaced. the symptoms of a worn insert are the same as with any wiper, chattering and skipping. when mine wore out, i took it apart (not easy) to examine the design, and found that it is obvious that the wiper could have been designed to use replaceable inserts, but wasn't! bosch's product designers certainly knew what they were doing: boost bosch's profitability by designing an expensive wiper that must be completely replaced when it wears out!",1

for several years i was having a problem with the sylvania silverstar bulbs burning out every to months. i loved the light so much that i tolerated it and replaced them with the same bulb.i was using the practice of letting the camry turn the lights on automatically with a turn of the ignition key. the process was () lights turn on () engine starts. i could see the lights flutter a little during the starting process.i then experimented by manually turning on the lights after the car was started. it has now been years with no bulb burnouts. i believe turning the ignition with the lights already in auto on creates extra wear and tear resulting in more frequent burn-outs.,1

"i have not tried it with a draw near its max of w but at lower draws it is fine and always runs cool, thanks to the built in fan. that is also the only negative i have after a month with the unit -- fan noise. it is loud enough to be noticeable over normal road noise, although the car radio drowns it out at normal volume. i think i can put up with the fan because otherwise it seems a very good unit. maybe they could hook the fan to a sensor and only have it run when the unit gets hot. the shape is good for my pickup's dash arrangement and being all-in-one it doesn't slide around or need securing. overall, a good unit that has done the job.",1

"i like these locks because they look great, function fine, and cost much less than the same locks re-branded by car manufactures. as the product description mentions, mcgard makes the oems car dealerships add-on. my car dealer wanted the same locks with their label at about triple the price so i saved some money and purchased these instead.i have these on two honda vehicles and have no problems so far. the only complaints i've heard of is from people loosing or stripping the keys. mcgard does offer replacement keys so save the documentation that comes with the locks. i'm sure stripped keys is caused by over torque'ing. these things can handle torque at least up to honda's specifications for lug nuts on my wheels. if you like to tighten things as tight as your he-man strength can put out, consider using a torque wrench to make sure you do not over tighten and ruin the key. be advised over tightening can be worse than under tightening.",1

"very little care appears to have been put into this product. the first time i unrolled it to test it out, the cap on one end sprung off, so i right away had to spend a few minutes putting it back together. it's simple but a bit intricate - the first time i put it on backwards, since there's no easy way to tell, and it's harder to open up than close. then i started putting it in my window, and it would invariably pop off within a few minutes even when the car is stopped. sometimes when it falls, it springs apart again, too. strong, direct sunlight definitely makes it pop off quicker, and since blocking the intense california heat is exactly what i bought it for, i'd say it's a failure.",1

"overall, the homeright auto wash stick works well on flat surfaces but if your car has wheel well mouldings, fender flares, spoilers, air dams, roof racks, or just about anything not flat, i find it hard to get those areas. and many places can't be gotten to no matter what. it earns a star because where it can be used it works pretty good. if your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. mine is a hard one to wash so when i get done, i let it dry then go back and wash the areas i missed by hand. even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. it feels a little light duty and i worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well i would probably buy another.",1

"this powerful yet inexpensive inverter is very well made. with its watt continuous capability you can successfully power up various devices in your car. modified sine wave is suitable since most of the modern electronic devices have switching supply anyway. only direct electrical motor devices may have some problem with this.the only drawback in my opinion is that the fan is always running what creates a certain sound. it would be essential to run the fan only in case of large power consumption and a significant temperature raise. the similar ""smart fan"" feature has been employed almost everywhere these days. the unneeded noise in the car caused by this fan is just a little annoyance and forced me to give this excellent unit only stars.otherwise, this is a highly recommended buy.",1

"i use this for outdoor automotive work and foundation repair under my house. the black body is stiff and strong, quite comfortable too. it is an excellent design. my only complaint is that the casters bring down the overall performance of the creeper. the ads say, ""wide, flotation-type tread,"" but these solid tires don't have any tread at all. the are hard plastic, and mostly flat. as a result they don't ""float"" over surface irregularities like a rounded pneumatic or low-density tire would. on pavement, the creeper gets hung up on air hoses, tools, etc. because of the rigid tires. on dirt, the creeper tends to sink into the ground, again because of the rigid tires. i weigh lbs.i may end up buying a better set of casters, but for [the money] i expected a top-notch product right out of the box. this is probably the best creeper for outdoor work, but it would be unstoppable if pegasus had selected better casters.",1

"while i was initially attracted to this product for the sterling glamour of its silvery surface, this soon tarnished once i began operating its more than yielding button interface. yes, it is very generous in how it allows you to press and poke it to command a number of operations; but it is almost too generous, and with each push of a button it sinks into disrepute, servility and debasement. i once esteemed its silvery resplendence. this product now impresses me as nothing more than painted chattel to be abused by paupers and mendicants, to daub with their oily fingers.i can have no more of this disreputable product.",0

"the inflator works well - push the chuck firmly onto the tire, and the guage shows the pressure. the trigger and air release buttons make it easy to get the right pressure, and i think that the guage is quite accurate. the only problem is that the spring-loaded clip that holds the chuck onto the valve stem of the tire can interfere with certain rims. the unit i received looks slightly different from the picture here. on mine, the lever for the chuck is mounted inward, that is, on the same side as the chuck air hole. depending on how cramped the space around the valve stem is, you may not be able to release the lever with the chuck on the valve. to inflate the tires on my vw passat, i had to flex the valve stem quite a bit to create the necessary clearance. not a terminal problem, but one that could so easily be avoided by putting the lever on the back of the chuck, or as it is shown in the image here.",1

we started with this one but were loathe to drill into the door to secure it. we tried double sided tape but the plastic was warped and curved and would not stay. this product is cheap (in every sense). it does not hold that many bags and is a bit of a pain to use since it does not hold that much and you really have to push and pull to get the bags in and out. we replaced it with a metal version that hangs over the top of the door and is working much better.,1

"the beauty of this charger is that it can rejuvenate a sulfided battery. if you let your battery run down completely, sulfite forms on the plates from the sulfuric acid that is in the battery. the sulfite insulates the plates and the battery no longer works. this charger has the feature that pulses the battery and breaks up the sulfite.this charger is very safe, fast and powerful, especially for it's size.the reason for only four stars is that if your battery is completely dead (if you left the lights on all day and night), this charger refuses to charge the battery and gives the code that the battery is no good. this is probably a safety issue, since it does not detect any voltage and therefore can't tell if you have the battery hooked up backwards. if you can get a little charge into the battery (jump it or use a different charger), then this charger recognizes the battery and will charge it the rest of the way.",1

"i haven't used this yet in a ""real"" situation (i.e. siphoning gas from a neighbor's car). but i did try siphoning water from my sink to my bathtub.as others have noted, it was tricky to get this siphon to work especially in shallow liquid. but after a little practice, suddenly it worked pretty well.i found it worked best when i moved the hose really straight in an up/down motion as opposed to just shaking it hopefully.i think the good thing about this siphon is its overall simplicity. it's basically a hose, making it pretty durable and also easy to clean.the downside is that the ball bearing inside doesn't create a great seal. hence if you stop shaking the hose, the fluid will flow back into the source tank pretty quickly.",1
"i bought a scooter, and as a result of not driving my car as much, its security system drained the battery. this solar trickle charger was all that was needed to make it start right up even if it sat for a couple of weeks. my only complaint is that the suction cups don't want to stick very well given the curvature of the window glass. it could use more suction cups or bigger or softer ones. or a different attachment strategy altogether. i made hangars out of some thin, stiff wire to hook over the top edge of the window and roll it up. works great and doesn't fall off whenever the temperature changes like the suction cups did.car batteries are not designed to be deep discharged. one deep discharge in cold weather can destroy a brand new battery. this will not only save me inconvenience, but money.",1

"this would have been a great item to have with me on a recent road trip where i got a flat tire on the interstate in the dark. after that experience, i am making sure never to leave home without an emergency light such as this. it serves two functions - to warn passing cars that i am pulled over, and to light up my work area to change a tire in the dark. it's a compact item, so it stores easily in the car at all times. the led lights are very bright.",1
"the construction seems solid enough, but be warned it's not intended to be mounted outside in the weather. mount it on your dashboard under the windshield.the current produced is extremely small. you will not charge a battery in a day or with this panel. it says ""maintainer"", and that's what it is. it will only provide enough power to keep a battery from going bad. just for fun, i hooked it up to a small electric motor and wheels, and at high noon with no cloud cover it couldn't even move itself.",1
i was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy. i need a cargo box that i can put up alone on top the acura mdx-just the right size. the box was easy to assemble - less than an hour. it is also easy to attach to the vehicle. the box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver mdx.i just wish the plastic was a little thicker but i think it will hold up well. the box is sturdy after assembling it,1
i was really looking forward to using this product when washing the vehicle and loading the roof top carrier. unfortunately it won't work on a highlander limited. the metal bar that sits across the back of the tire will not fit between the tire and the coil spring housing. bummer.apart from that little problem the product is well designed and of high quality. i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if it will fit your vehicle.,1

while i've only had rain twice since i bought them the wipers seem todo a very good job. shipping is another thing. the cost was over $.and the were shipped seperately. the two boxes they came in would nothave fit in the trunk of my pontiac bonneville. the boxes and packingweighed much more than the wiper blades. i did not save any money dueto shipping charges. i could have bought locally for the same cost orless.,0

"i bought of these to replace similar blind spot mirrors i had on my jeep liberty. i like these better than my old ones, which were a different brand. the old ones had grown foggy over time. these have a better quality reflective surface than my old ones did when i bought them new. i would recommend these for passenger vehicles with standard size mirrors. they take care of the blind spots without covering up much of the rest of the mirror. however, if your mirrors are larger - and could accommodate it - i would recommend a larger size, because ."" x ."" is actually quite small. be aware that these do come with the ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear"" warning and that there is only one mirror per package.",1

"i mistakenly ordered this because it looks like the thing i set out to buy, namely the carpad itself with its raised edges to contain melted snow and dirt. in fact it's simply a cover to place over an existing carpad, and only useful if you have studded tires.i called the manufacturer and they told me this mistake has happened to several amazon customers.",1

"i purchased this scanner and hooked it up to my subaru forester. it didn't work. when i called the company, they immediately knew of the problem, and told me i would need to ship the code reader back to them to have the chip re-programmed. best part is that they want me to pay the shipping! innova should really recall all their scanners and fix them, or offer free shipping to have them reprogrammed. it might work for many other cars, but the subaru is obdii compliant, and the code reader should work out of the box.",1
i was disappointed at the color temperature of this product as it is still very yellowish compared to my hid xenon low beam. otherwise it is quite easy to swap with my oem bulbs.,0
"this charge controller works as any voltage regulator does. i use it to regulate a watt solar panel that maintains the charge on a gate opener battery. would have rather been told in the product description that it was not weather proof. had to seal the case where the front & back meet. since it works as advertised, will use it until the circuit board corrodes and fails.",1

"actually i cannot truly rate this product, as the other heater i purchased works great and was a lot easier to install. so i am keeping this one as a back up in case the other ever fails me. but, if it's as good as the other i purchased, i would assume it would be fine.",0

pretty cool tool altogether. easy to use for reading and resetting codes. if you want to use your laptop to download and analyze data you are sol if your laptop is anywhere near new. that's cause this puppy does not have a usb interface. you will need to buy a serial(rs-) to usb converter and hope the driver is included. sort of surprising in this day and age especially as portability is the essence of this device that you can't use it out of the box with a laptop!,1

we ended up buying two of the heated seat cushions. used to have heated seats in one car but after spending $ to replace it and it broke again i decided this was the way to go. the only problem with the product is that it doesn't have any body. every time you get into the car seat it gets all squished up. if it had a firm seat and back to keep it in place it would be better but for under $.you can't beat it. the heat works wonderfully.,1

"i've used meguiars gold for many years and decided to try out the new tech.pros:the paint doesn't collect as much dust as with meguiars gold, which is a great benefit.the paint seems just as protected as using the meguiars gold.has more of a clean shine to the paint like a new car would.goes on easy, you dont need as much wax.cons:does not fill hairline scratches at all, meguires gold seems to cover things as it is thicker and builds up.if your car is not new and has scratches or spiderwebbing, you need to use a scratch remover polish first.conclusion, for new cars this is a perfect wax. for older cars with more blemishes more work is needed before application of this wax. overall i will continue to use this wax. i won't be throwing out the gold though, it is still a great wax too.",1

"purchased the solar battery charger to keep a lawn mower charged while out on my lawn. the manual says that it should not be used outdoors, and not come in contact with water. not sure what the purpose of this product is then, and page manual provides zero information. upon opening the packaging, the top and bottom part of the plastic case were coming apart, and there was no gasket in between the two plastic parts (one reason i guess it is not waterproof). connected it up, and left it charge for a couple weeks. the plastic case had already melted in several locations, and the wires to the battery had cracked (bad strain reliefs). i have ended up just throwing this away. it is inexpensive, but you pay for what you get with this product. perhaps i got a bad product, but not willing to try another one.",0

"first i will complain about how much i hate it when a company takes their floor display and reboxes it to send you as new. i had to wash the bonnet before use because it was dirty and wet wipe the handle. just because we buy over the internet does not mean you can treat us as second class shoppers. that being said here is my review.my stars only refers to the product after its first use. used it on my lanai(patio) windows and it was quite clumsy to manuver. it made a water mess unless you tried to squeeze out the excess water which is difficult. i haven't tried it on my car yet that is coming soon, then i will update. it may have a user learning period but at first try ""user friendly"" is not its nickname.",0
"i agree with the other reviewers who said this product needs an o-ring. i found it very difficult to get it to seal on the tire valve stem, but with the o-ring it works perfectly. (why they don't manufacture it that way i don't know). but by getting an inexpensive o-ring from ace hardware you have a product that is outstanding. another reviewer said the size o-ring he bought was / x / x /. however i found this size was too small and didn't fit. i had to get / x / x /, and it's a perfect fit. and with tax it cost me a mere . cents. an easy modification well worth it.",1
"i got it because it was cheap. i got what i paid for. i have no idea what the magnets said to be inside are for and it doesn't bother explaining it in the packaging. it's basically cheap foam on a cardboard backing with a thin cover. it does cushion a little, but it's not something most folks would rave about. other than covering a hole in a worn out car seat, i'm not sure what the purpose of it is. it does have a pretty good system for strapping it to the seat, with sets of connectors.",1
"i got this because the area i live in wants to inspect my car for emissions and i wanted to make sure i didn't have problems before i took the car to the inspection station. there's nothing worse than finding out you have a problem than when the inspector tells you.i read the instructions (something that a lot of reviewers neglected to do). what i found out was that i had several errors, all minor, but decipherable from the instruction book. that's what you get for bucks.if you have half a brain, this thing is very usable.",1
"i would have given it stars, but did not have the opportunity to evaluate the a charge/start mode. overall this unit functions perfectly, and its light weight and ample ac cord and battery cable length make it easy to hook up and use. i have used other chargers previously, but none had the automatic shut off and trickle charge modes.",1
"i opened the box up for the valley hitch cargo basket and i was a little disapointed in how light duty it is. everything about it except for the inch bar seems week. i also found that one of the supports underneath the unit had only been tack welded on and had broke loose i am going to take it to a fab shop that i know and see if they can fix that, and maybe add some strength here and there. i just thought it would have been a stronger unit. lets put it this way i would not try to stand on it accept maybe over the inch tube but not on eather end i think it would just bend right down. we are taking it on our vacation and i hope we do not have any problems with it. i do not think i would buy from this company again.",1
"i've only used the brush standalone, and haven't hooked it up to a hose. i got it to clean the vinyl siding on my house and it works very well. when using the brush with telescoping handle, you do really have to tighten it to keep it from working its way loose. it seems to be very durable so far. i took it to a work day last weekend and some of the teenagers helping out thought it was a push broom, so it spent the day sweeping up dirt and leaves. with a quick rinse, it looked good as new. i was impressed. it's a great buy in my opinion. i give it stars because the rings that clamp the handle in telescoping mode are plastic, not metal.",1
"the q mv pump is a great device. and it works just as advertised. my only issue with it is (or was) that the power cord was too short. so i got out the soldering iron and added about ' of cord.the problem could have been solved by extending the air line, but it tended to coil up thus putting stress on the valve stem.great unit nonetheless.",1

"yeah, you can do it !!required a little creativity to follow the exact directions and select the specific hardware to install on my chevy express .did require two / inch holes to be drilled. not too easy, but worth the effort. comes with tons of hardware to adapt to many vehicles.seems plenty stout, but haven't pulled anything yet.",1
"not that good. i based my purchasing decision on the great reviews here, but should have paid more attention to the one negative. yes, it does a good job sucking up water, but it'll be completely saturated in just a few seconds, and then you're ringing the heck out of it to get the water out of it. another couple of seconds, and it's completely soaked again, and you're ringing the heck out of it again. a real pain to be constantly ringing it out just to use it for another couple of seconds. and if you don't ring it out, it'll just streak and leave large amounts of water behind. i suppose if i had or of them i wouldn't be complaining, but i had money to buy or of these at $ a pop, i wouldn't be washing my car myself. i'll stick with my good, clean, cotton towels to dry...",0
"i am satisfied with this product. it is quick and easy to use. the only complaint i have is that it promises to erase fault codes therefore turning of the ""service engine light"" i found that even though it does the warning light comes right back the following day for the same reasons. other than the above, the codes readings are clear and seem accurate.pizzo",0
"like other reviewers on here, i too was tired of those cheap, flimsy roll-up sunshades. so when i purchased my new car earlier this year, i was determined to get a nice one for it, with cost not an issue. i checked around and the covercraft seemed to fit the bill. the overall contruction is excellent and very well made. there's even a soft, felt-like lining on the inside to avoid scratching the dash. and that is my only complaint with the sunshade. if you have a black dash like i do, the grey felt material ""sheds"" from the daily folding and unfolding, leaving small particles on the dash that need to be wiped away weekly. true, this is a minor quibble and certainly not a deal-breaker. with that being the case, i wholeheartedly recommend covercraft to anyone looking for a premium sunshade.",1

"this product works well for travelers using rental cars or airlines. i gave it four as opposed to five stars because the adjustment process (blowing into a tube then trying it) is inherently a litte tedious. and over-inflating can be bad for your back as well.on the other hand, it stuffs into your carry-on/briefcase with no problem and works well once adjusted. so the ability to deflate it completely is also inherent to its value.",1

"i did a disc brake conversion on my ""muscle car"" and thought this would ease the bleeding process somewhat. if there are any leaks in the system you'll be there for weeks doing your bleeding. with all new plumbing and fittings, leaks are inevitable. this will just draw more air into the system and you find the bleeding (and pumping) goes on forever. with the two man operation leaks show up and you're able to tighten/fix the problem areas. it will draw a vacuum as advertised but the included cup is rather small and becomes messy as you empty it. all-in-all the old conventional pump and hold system works better.",1

i bought a pair of these for my load warrior basket. it's not obvious from the specs but these are thin plastic covers with a metal lock. some leverage with a screwdriver should break them off. they're better than nothing but pricey for what you get. try buying one pair and not two as the manufacturer's description recommends and see how you like them.,1

"item was received in a thin, torn cardboard box. amazon was selected as the vendor (there are many online for this item)based on overall cost (free shipping). item had a bent rear lid and hinge. the welds in the aluminum were cracked or simply not holding two edges together in several places. this item says it was manufactured in arkansas - not china. shameful quality. i was going to return it, but shipping was $. - which amazon refunded so i could make repairs myself.",1

"the one thing that this product doesn't stress enough is that your results may very depending on the type of damage you have. this product is not very good on star cracks or regular cracks (it may work better on bullseyes). i have a star crack about ."" in diameter with the longest crack extending about / inch from the point of impact. i've read and fallowed the instructions times and after few tries the product did fill in the small spider web like cracks that extend no longer then /"" from the point of impact but the longer cracks are still there and still visible. the damage does look a little bit better then before the repair but it's definitely nothing like the before and after picture the manufacturer provides. honestly i don't really care how it looks as long as it passes the state inspection but i'll find that out in few months.overall i can only give this product stars, and if you are going to buy this don't expect miracles.",1

"these wipers work great, but so do the regular wipers. i agree with the last poster, though these are supposed to be lower profile (no steel scaffolding along the length of the rubber blades) the attachment point to the wiper arms are atrociously bulky. they are an eyesore. however, they do not stick out as far as the oem style but since the rest of the blade is lower profile, it makes that particular hump stand out. i was able to modify it to make lower profile and it actually looks awesome. it should not take modifying the wipers to make them look better but its possible.",0
as we were looking for a car top carrier we came across this car back carrier and thought it would be ideal for a trip with our grand kids since we needed the back of our car open for our dog. it worked perfectly on our trip and we plan to use it in a few months to take our grand kids to yellowstone! we also noticed several people behind us on the road writing down the name of the carrier! the only two items that i think could be improved are . the carrier needs a more rigid bottom. we had to put a piece of plywood in the bottom of the carrier and . since it covers up license plate it should have a way of attaching the plate securely to the carrier. we took our plate off the car and taped it in our back window but since our windows are tinted it was hard to see it.,1

i bought this scanner as a xmas gift for my dad. he's tested it on his gm pickup and my mom's pontiac. it sync'd up with the cars and worked as advertised.the only reason why i don't give it stars is we haven't had to use it for any serious diagnostic purposes yet - and that's why i bought it.,0
works good for turning vinyl looking new but supposed to clean as well? i could have rubbed with plain water and got same results as far as cleaning goes. not worth the money if you are looking for protection and cleaning both. dh- is misleading cause it's not uv but maybe closer to uv- rating? i gave it below average cause it's supposed to do both clean and protect and jury still out on protect.good luck,0
"this worked well and fixed the broken grid wires on the rear defogger. best advice is to fix broken grids before winter as it was cold out and i had to keep the window warm with a heat gun. the mask provided is great, but the bottle was small and once opened became messy and could not be closed again. try to finish your repairs in one effort. also, the repairs are copper-colored and visible up close, but not in the rear-view mirror.",1

"installed this in a new chevy van. the van only came with a single, wire horn which made replacement simple. i went the route of splicing new female wire connectors into the factory wiring and preserving the factory horn connector. for those not up for this challenge, simply cut the factory connector off and crimp on weather resistant female wire connectors. i had high expectations for a loud truck-like sound. no question that it is loud...far louder than the wimpy stock horn. it is not the deep, booming blast you get with multi trumpet air horns. overall, i am quite pleased with this horn: compact unit, simple install, attention getting volumne/sound. as a bonus, it includes a horn relay (not needed for my application) which is not listed in any online listing i viewed.",1

"i have titled this the cutting edge for a specific reason. i cut my finger trying to open the case. this has got to be a major flaw which palmone designers totally missed. the case itself is nice, has a rubber edge for protection as well as on the back. the hinged aluminum cover is where the problems begin. you need a finger nail in order to open the snap of the case. the edge is sharp and if you happen to slide your fingernail against the edge of the case, you can expect to get cut which is what happened to me. the price of the case does not warrant the design flaws and it is way too expensive considering that the life drive already costs an arm and a leg. i hope that palmone will take a look at this case and make improvements for functionality and safety.",1

"unlike the horror stories i've heard elsewhere regarding battery damage during shipping, my battery arrived (upside down!) in undamaged condition. there aren't many auto batteries that can boast that. after removing the original battery i cleaned up the corroded battery terminals with an acid-neutralizing spray. the new optima battery dropped straight in and i clamped it down using the original clamp and bolt. this battery fitted very nicely into my vw gti .t, no modifications required. i now have confidence in cranking the engine on those bitter winter mornings. the only negative is the price compared to similar capacity batteries and the shortish warranty. hence the stars. all in all, a good product and i'm happy with my purchase so far.",1

"i wasn't able to use this player through my pioneer vsx-txvi avr, would not pass video via hdmi. i believe this is a pioneer receiver problem and not the players fault? some people sent the receiver in for a firmware fix and it seemed to resolve this issue.the only way i could get the player to work was straight through to the display(hdmi), and it rendered a beautiful picture. i believe a fimware fix might be in order from toshiba to fix this problem, until then, i'll keep my st generation xa that works just fine for now.from what i hear this is the best player to date, best sd upconversion thanks to the awesome reon chip inside, and the build quality is fantastic, anodized aluminum sides all the way around. the player is half the size of my xa.i'm really in a small minority group having an hdmi issue, if you want the best hd dvd player, get this one for sure!",0

this is better than some other's i've tried...it hasn't died yet.placing the sensor probe in an appropriate area is tricky. my gauge shows outrageously high temps (even in the winter) until the vehicle is moving then it is pretty accurate. the probe has an adheasive back to allow you to stick it somewhere. i haven't done this because i'm moving it around to see where it works best. i've tried a few of these type of sensors and none seem to be as good as the factory installed types on the cars that are equiped with them (kind of a no brainer).bottom line...better than nothing for me.,1

"please take this with a grain of salt as i am receiving it from a forum of knowledgeable mechanics. it has been stated that these accumulators are 'new old stock' meaning that they are in fact new but are twenty years old. the accumulator, it is said, have a rubber bladder, this i know for fact as i cut my old one in half to see, and that an inert gas is on the top side thereby providing the needed pressure 'accumulation'. the problem with the twenty year old part is the inert gas has seeped over the twenty years through the rubber bladder and are not able to provide the designed pressure accumulation. i have noticed a decline in the performance of this newly acquired part over the last few months of operation. it is still much better than the old part i replaced, but one might be better off buying a newer nos part from a reputable dealer/supplier.",1

works good for turning vinyl looking new but supposed to clean as well? i could have rubbed with plain water and got same results as far as cleaning goes. not worth the money if you are looking for protection and cleaning both. dh- is misleading cause it's not uv but maybe closer to uv- rating? i gave it below average cause it's supposed to do both clean and protect and jury still out on protect.good luck,0

"this is really a standalone product as far as protectants go. it has a nice scent, lasts for a very long time, and doesn't leave a glossy/greasy finish.the only negative is that it does tend to attract dust and lint, but due to the long-lasting nature of the stuff, you can just wipe the dash off with a dustcloth where most protectants would require a new application. so it's hard to tell if it is really this stuff collecting more dust or if it is just more obvious because the product is still there.i think it's far superior to armor all and formula offerings that are now commonly sold. it's too bad this stuff is hard to find at stores.",1

"anyone who likes really clean windows knows that you have to clean the windshield about separate times using many paper towels. the reason for this is that you have to remove all of that greasy film on the windshield. you would need to have about spare bonnets to do the same thing with this tool. otherwise, it just moves the film around from one place to another.on the plus side, it does get into those hard to reach places, and some that are impossible to reach otherwise. i found that you can fold a paper towel in half and then use this tool to move it around the windshield. so it does have some merit.",1

i ordered these after i finally got around to replacing my jeep wrangler's headlights with silverstars. these were for my foglights and between those and the headlights light brightness and reach were increased %. the only reason i didn't give stars is because my bmw's have xenons and those are better still. i was next to a lexus with regular lights one morning and mine were definitely brighter. a friend with a jeep wrangler is planning to get some after seeing the difference.,1

"i purchased two of these, one for a camry and the other for a sienna. it is a very easy installation, just pop off the filter cover for the old one and slip these pre-oiled filters in. great for a car's lifetime. two words of caution though: ) buy the cleaner and oil kit because you will need it to clean the filter after about - miles and ) make sure you install the filter correctly. the filter has a curved corner that matches perfectly with the filter box. if you are not attentive, you might not align it correctly and close the box without a good seal. i'm sure the instructions might tell you this, i never took the time, but i guess i had enough time to install it twice. after about miles, it seems to increase the fuel efficiency, but don't expect dilythium crystal - like increases/savigns. if you plan on keeping the car a lot of miles, the savings will add up.",1

this remote works pretty well. i was disappointed though that the software and firmware that was sent with the unit was out of date and i had to download a mb file to update it before i could even use the remote. the setup over the net went fairly smoothly. over all it works pretty good. it does get confused sometimes and does not turn on or off a certain component. over all though it works well and it is so cool to only have to push one button and see components turn on. this remote allows all functions for all the original remote controls. you just have to drill down to get to them.,0

"i am a professional technician, and use many power tools every day, this tool does its job well. if you are not used to using a professional grade tool, you may find this tool heavy, and possibly overpowered for the job (it will break stuck fasteners rather than working them loose if you are not careful). also, the picture shows an extended anvil, which this wrench does not have (read the description).",1

"well made and does the job just fine. it will work on almost any v battery. naturally it does not replace what an electric battery charger can do and in the same amount of time, but as a trickle charger for car and boat batteries this is all you need (other than some sunshine). the only negative is that these sunsei solar panels are far more expensive than they need to be. they are made in china and a w panel of this quality should be -% less than what the sunsei brand demands. coleman is pretty much the same product, all coming from icp solar in canada, however the coleman panels cost much less.",1
"these kinda things always work good the first or second time you try them, well usually anyway. the true test is next year when i need it and drag it out of the bottom drawer of my tool box, will it still work then??? guess we'll have to wait and see.i had bought the white plastic one (forgot brand name on it, but it's all white and all plastic) a couple of years ago. got uses out of it, and you guessed it, pulled it out to use it and no go. hence the reason i had to buy this one",0

"this is an okay waste container, but i found that it was not worth it to me to pay this much for something which has similar competition for less money. i bought it for two daughters as well as myself, and they were underwhelmed. it is good if you tend to toss wet trash in a waste recepticle and don't want leakage, but beyond that it is not worth the price. it won't tip over, which is good, but i would hope that by the time someone is middle-aged like me, they would know how to handle garbage without making a huge mess in the car.",0

these were bought to replace the shocks on my stock ford ranger xlt. unlike the matching kyb front shocks these bolted up with easy and fit like they were made for the truck. consideration should be given to end use. i typically have to hundred pound loads in the bed of my truck. i also have a car trailer attached from time to time. in this enviroment these shocks excel and the stability they provided was far better than i could have hoped. if someone is going to use these shocks on a truck that rarley carries weight you might find them to be a little rough riding and harsh. but in a couple of days i got used to it and do not even notice it anymore.,1
"i gave these a low rating because they are not well described. they are quality stands but they are not for cars. you'd think they would've written the height in the description or say that it is for trucks/suvs only. they are extremely tall (even at the lowest setting), and i couldn't get them under my car.",0

"let me start first by saying the positive aspects of this item.this pump does work and it works well. its gauge has a knob that you turn so that once it reaches a certain psi, it turns off automatically. this is great because you don't have to stand around watching it to make sure it doesn't over-pressurize whatever you're pumping. the gauge is also illuminated for nighttime use.now for the drawbacks. unless you're pumping up a bike tire or something small, this pump takes a long time to pressurize. also, the wall outlet cord that comes with this pump is ridiculously short, around a foot and a half long or so. also, the tube you hook up to whatever you're pumping is really short too, probably around as long as the cord.overall, however, this pump is great for its price and i'd recommend it if you have an extension cord and no need to pump something up quickly.",1

well it worked well. i cranked it down really tight but you have to play with the straps to make sure you don't get an annoying vibration whistle. the one thing they really need is something to put between the straps and the car.

i bought this for my f and it doesnt really fit the contour of the seat very well. therefore it tends to slide around a bit. the main reason i went with this one is because my truck has a standard transmission and it was the only one that wouldnt be in the way of the shifter. the adjusters on the cupholders dont really work that well either. with not much force they will pop back out to the next position.. the rest of it seems fairly sturdy and the storage compartments seem to work well. not a terrible product but there are better consoles out there.,1

"got this item for work after seeing a similar item on mythbuster. it came via usps in an envelope. the item has it's own plasic orange carrying case. it came with a volot battery. the unit has a blue backlight that illuminates during measuring and makes a beeping sound. after releasing the trigger, it held the value for seconds before shuting off. it emits a red spot laser for aiming and can be turned off if desired. the negatives is it's only accurate on flat non-reflective surfaces. also it had trouble reading samll heat souces. in our case we had a heater block that's "" square. even with the unit up close it didn't give an accurate reading. the range is deg c and we're using it in the deg range. very accurate. picked out hot and cold spots on the heating unit which was very useful.",1

"even though i have a portable garmin nuvi gps system, which works very well, i find i often need to know in exactly which direction i am headed, e.g., when the nuvi says, ""go north to ..."" i had purchased one of these compasses for one of my vehicles, and decided to buy one for the other.i have found that it works very well, once it is calibrated, unless the batteries vibrate loose. it was very difficult for me to figure out how to open the battery compartment, since they provide no understandable instructions, but very easy to do so once i figured it out. i wish the backlight would stay on longer after being turned on. i find it interesting to see how much the direction shown changes before and after calibration, i.e., after it has adjusted for the car's magnetic field with the engine running.",1

i'm a little disappointed in hi-lift jack. top is piece and welded in the middle. should have been one piece. they supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it. a bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport. the hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely. all in all a good add-on for your hi-lift jack but it could have been designed a little better.,1

"i bought this as a portable fuel tank for camping with a generator and atvs. one thing the details don't tell you when buying this is that it is not recommended as a ""portable"" fuel tank... nice that they tell you before you buy it... not. but i use it anyway and just rigged up a grounding wire (recommended) to my truck. the unit uses gravity flow to work, therefore the bottom of the tank must be higher than anything you fill. my pickup sits high so it works... if you just have a standard pickup, even an adult atv/quad could be questionable. filled with fuel this tank is heavy, so once filled and in your pickup, you'll need the hulk to lift it any higher if needed.again as i stated, it works for me, but i could see how this may not work for everyone. the quality is good and i have had no problems with it at all.happy pumping :-)",1

for several years i was having a problem with the sylvania silverstar bulbs burning out every to months. i loved the light so much that i tolerated it and replaced them with the same bulb.i was using the practice of letting the camry turn the lights on automatically with a turn of the ignition key. the process was () lights turn on () engine starts. i could see the lights flutter a little during the starting process.i then experimented by manually turning on the lights after the car was started. it has now been years with no bulb burnouts. i believe turning the ignition with the lights already in auto on creates extra wear and tear resulting in more frequent burn-outs.,1

i've owned several of these over the years and never had a major issue with one. a little bit of force always gets the plastic needle seated in the bleeder until its time to pull it out and switch wheels. remember to empty the bottle into a bigger bottle when you move to the next wheel and you shouldn't have an issue with leaks or spills. i've never had a problem finding a place for the magnet to stick but have heard of people using part of a clothes hanger to hang it in place while pumping the brakes.,1

"i have purchased mcgard wheel locks in the past and can't say i ever had a problem with them. i was most pleased to see that they now come in a set of five as i needed to also secure the spare tire on my boat trailer. also, since my last purchase, mcgard has improved their key by making it into a socket like device which makes it easier to use. i would like to see the set come with two keys, so i recommend that anyone buying these locks to spend the few extra dollars and order a duplicate key after you receive your locks and keep it in a secure separate place just in case the original becomes lost. thanks rb...",1

"so i spent countless hours researching every tv on the market. i finally decided on this tv when i was in circuit city. while i was there i happened to bump into a technician that installs the tv's for c.c. and best buy. he told me that this tv was great, but after a couple of years you would notice a deterioration of the monitor quality(i.e. green streaks). he said to go to best buy and look at the display tvs that have been on the floor for more than hours. he recommended the samsung hl-sw "" p dlp hdtv or a pioneer plasma(if i could afford it). just ordered my samsung yesterday from amazon with the stand for $. not a bad deal, although i will have to buy a new bulb every hours.i still think that this sony is the better tv, but not in the long run.",0
"we bought five resqme's. each of our cars has one tywrapped to the left side of the steering column. they're there so they can be found easily in an emergency. we also have one on our keychains for the times we ride as passengers in friend's cars. our area of the pacific northwest is heavily infested with ponds, lakes, deep creeks, canals, rivers, and scenic oceanside roadways. each means a blown tire (and loss of control) could put us into the water. such a simple and inexpensive tool, near at hand, findable in the dark, can mean the difference between life or a miserable death. i hope we never, never need to use them but i don't want to die thinking, ""really wish i had spent a little on one of those window breaker gizmos.""

let me start by saying that i've never been upside down in a submerged car trying to cut my seatbelt off and shatter the window to get out but if i was there are better safety hammers/tools on the market. this one is lightweight and reminds me of a toy. i'm afraid it would break before the window would. it does have a sharp point and cutting edge both untried by me. it just doesn't instill confidence. look elsewhere and spend a little more for the real thing.,0

"i absolutely love the concept of this product. i was actually going to make one myself from plexiglass, but found this one available. i bought two, one for me and one for my sister. we are both fairly short and bothered by the sun sitting just below where our car's visor reaches. i love the sliding part that makes it darker in that spot to eliminate the direct sun's rays. the only drawback for me is the fact that it sort of vibrates when it is fully extended, which kind of blurrs your vision through it. the first time i used it, it gave me a headache. i guess i could blame part of that on the vibration in my car. if you drive a very smooth-riding luxury car, it would be better. anyway, i am keeping mine, but using it only when the sun is at it's worst. i would recommend this product, it just takes a little getting used to.",1

i had thehigh road swingaway&trade; driver organizer xlversion of this for years but it was really too big and most annoying is that things would fit through under the pocket dividers so you could never guess where something was. this model has better divided pockets sot hat won't happen but it is small and the pockets on the front are shallow and not gusseted so they hold less than they look like they do. the pocket that holds the sunglasses in the photo is oddly shaped but the real issue is that is cuts into the space of the main compartment.i have no clue what the little extra handles are for??? all in all i would say this is well made (better than its xl cousin) and the 'swing-away' idea is right for me but i just wish there were something between this and the xl size... instead i ditched a bunch of stuff and maybe that is what needed to happen anyway.,1

it works as advertised. i purchased of them. one is to help my wife park her prius. the other was for my pt cruiser however i always back in and the overhead door would block the device so i'll have to think of some clever place to put it other than beaming down thru the windshield. the only negative is the very poor double sided sticky tape they provide. it failed within one hour so i used some industrial strength velcro. i have a steel i beam right where the device needed to mount otherwise i would have just used screws and anchors into the drywall ceiling.,1

"very nice. heavy duty. easy to install. everything you need to get the job done. there were plenty of electrical connectors. i opted to purchase a new battery cable (battery to bolt-on end) so my cables would be exact length i needed without having them flop around and ground out. addl cost under $.. the solenoid is a little bigger than i expected (because it is so heavy duty) so it was a little difficult to find a mount location in my jeep, but i don't think most users would find it as difficult to mount in their vehicle. i ran the switch into the driver area so i can switch it on as soon as i open the door and then use electronic controls to unlock the rest. instruction were clear and accurate.",1
"you need sets of these `yakima q clip sets' and the corresponding `yakima roundbars roof rack cross bars' (check your vehicle dimensions for the proper lengths), if you are planning to install a ski rack or any type of enclosure unit. i had these installed professionally for a little bit more money, and it was worth avoiding the hassle. they come with an extra set of keys and are very strong. they are simple and sleek. definitely a `must have' for a truck owner.",1
"this is an excellent product that seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well. sturdy and easy to handle do to the relatively light weight (compare the weight of this charger to ones with the more conventional transformer design). on the amp setting it rapidly charged my trailer batteries without breaking a sweat and it didn't seem to mind running on generator power (even though there is a microprocessor inside). the user interface may seem a little odd but it's easy to get used to and the digital display is nice. nice built-in pocket too for storing the power cord and charging ""clips"". i'm happy i returned the amp iron-heavy charger i had bought that wasn't doing the job and discovered and bought this one. shop around, though, the price really varies.",1

the price is right for what you get here. the product comes in a cheapo blow molded case. the actual driver set is constructed of aluminum. the tooling itself looks like it was machined ok but probably won't last forever because it's made from aluminum but the plus side to that is that the tool will be softer than the race your driving in and hopefully won't damage it. if i could do it over again i would have spent more money for a nicer kit.,1
"fast shipping, nice packed came with a film protection against scratchess, its heavy so its real good metal quality. the only thing i saw as a problem its not protected against rain or hummidity. what i did is i bought a clear silicone paste does like tooth paste kind and i covered the entire circuit so it won't burn the system when it rains. its a must for longlife use.mine is working great in rain and the leads don't heat up so its safe for the silicone to cover the back of the circuit system.if it would had come with the circuit covered plate for raini would have giving it a star rating.but it would not be business for them since it will last a long time.hope my feed back helps, i will try to upload a pic so you'll see how it looks.",1

"well, it works as expected. hit it with psi and it'll pull all the oil out of an oil pan or antifreeze out of a block. because it drafts through the dipstick tube, the draft tubes are rather small which translates to a fairly lengthy evacuation time. for my .l capacity engine, it took about minutes to completely empty. and that's getting nearly .l out, which is pretty empty! properly cleaning the tank is a little cumbersome because of all the bolts on the lid. i like my equipment really clean when i'm through with it so i actually unbolt the top and clean and wipe the inside. probably not necessary for most folks - a good rinsing with a solvent would suffice - but manageable nonetheless. overall, i'm very pleased with the evacuator and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to remove a drain plug ever again.",1

"this is a great panel to have, if you take good care of it. in full sunlight, it will put out the full watts and is fully weatherproof. it is not heavy duty though, so you cant just have it somewhere it might slip, or have it angled up with the chance of it falling down--because it will break. and you can't fix the glass in it if you take it apart. even when broken it still puts out the watts, it just needs to be kept weather safe.i got it at amazon's lowest price ever and i saw they went back up. but i would have already got another at that same price i got the first.this watt panel is the perfect size to charge batteries without a controller.",1

"generally, it provided all of the expected functions. i like the switch alignment with the cover slot feature to ensure it's not still powered-on when put away. the little bar-on-a-string, which is meant to pass through the cover slot (when fully open), creating sort of an a-frame stand is a clever idea, but poorly designed (the plastic bar tends to find its way through the slot and the ""stand"" falls flat). also, getting the two probes out of their compartment is difficult (use your fingernail) because the two rigid probes/flexible leads don't have quite enough allocated space, which also makes re-insertion of the probes into their storage compartment a challenge in dexterity.",1

"the steps themselves are great and the design pretty good alo, but the hardware they include is absolute crap. its cheap stainless bolts that break very easily, the type of stuff you can pay . apiece for at the hardware store. i would recommend going tot eh hardware store and buying hardened bolts. for the bolts the go through the truck body itself. i would also suggest getting longer ones so you can place a piece of steel behind the lip to reinforce it. makes the steps almost immovable.",1

"well packaged, in a vinyl zipper bag which tucks the manual and cd safely in a compartment, the unit itself is held in place with a velcro strap. it also comes with an extender interface cable to allow you to place the scanner on the passenger seat.i had a check engine light on and isolated the problem (rear o sensor) within minutes. next up i need to replace it, check again and clear the code. hopefully this will be as easy as it's been up to now.two features i'd like to see are a contrast control for the lcd screen and a backlight for low-light use. i was checking my car after work and it was dark out. the dome light in my car worked, but with lcd screens a backlight would make better sense.[see comment for the outcome of post-replacement of the failed o sensor]",1
"i was disappointed with the mat, i thought it would be longer. the piece only covers the hump in your truck and you need to buy the sides from husky liner for it to cover the whole carpet area. i think the mats are way overpriced. i kept the same mats that came with my truck and the hump mat does have gaps on both sides but at least it does cover more of the carpet area than if i had purchased a cheaper hump mat.",1
"really like this product. it came quickly, safely and super easy to set up. if you consider the free shipping it is just a couple of dollars more than the cheapest product without fs.wheel locks would merit five stars. be careful when you stand up. i use a rubber door stop i purchased at my hardware store to chock one of the wheels and it works great.. other than that buy it you will be pleasantly surprised.",1

"it's assembled with plastic gears, however, and the ""remote control"" is flimsy and pretty hokey looking. still, there are tons of the identical products floating around at harbor-freight, cost-plus, and so forth. some are upwards of $! so, if you're really looking for one of these v electric jacks, this is pretty much the cheapest one around. they haven't failed me yet.they are somewhat noisy as well.",1

"the jelly blade, with its silicone material, does a very nice job conforming to the shape of the car. it also tends to get far more water off in a single pass than a rubber squeegee, and thus is great for windows too. watch out, though: it's easy for gritty materials to get trapped in the blade where you can drag them across your car. wipe off the blade frequently and you should be good to go!",1

"a comfortable car seat is important, but keeping a car seat safe and dry is even more important. finding the right color to match the other covers in your seated-vehicle is a neverending struggle for some people. this product lists one for the color black. i don't know... black can produce a lot of heat. maybe it would be better to purchase one in the winter when the sun isn't so hot.",0
"it works as advertised but it has two major drawbacks: lack of any meaningful owner's manual and an extremely annoying beep that it makes everytime that backup power is used. since there is no owner's manual, i can't figure out how to disable this beep or if it can be disabled at all. this basically provides a few minutes of emergency backup so that you can safely turn off your devices in the event of a blackout or similar problems. but the beeps make it impossible to use the backup power for too long.",0
after seeing all of the reviews i thought that this would be great for recording lectures for school. ii gets great sound even in big lecture halls and recording and deleting a file is easy. however to work the other bells and whistles the directions didn't make much sence to me. even with trying to follow the pictures and the writen instructions step by step i just couldn't figure it out. so is it really worth the money? no not really.,0
"this is a good looking bag and it is built very well. it simply wasn't big enough to accommodate all my gear. if you only carry one camera, one more lens and one flash, this just might be right for you, but it doesn't really work for all the stuff that lowepro claims it will hold.",0

"a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest link on this thing is the lock. a professional thief doesn't even have to bend anything. a pro with an easily obtainable locksmith's tool will take seconds to open the device's ""tubular lock"" (aka ""barrel lock""). (you've probably seen barrel locks on those rigid u-shaped bicycle locks and on vending machines.)hey, at least the concept is not stupid like the club, and keeping amateurs at bay is a great thing.but i think that this device can give a false sense of security. if you really care about preventing theft you'll also want something like an alarm with a kill switch.",1

"i used one of these water-blades at a school car wash and was sold. the parent that brought the water-blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it, used it a lot. it does not remove all the water, you still have some small amounts that will require a towel, but this is a small amount. we used it on - cars at the car wash to pre-dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great! purchased one for myself, so i guess that's a good recommendation.",1

"i purchased these ramps after reading a number of positive reviews online. unlike some of the cheap looking variants sitting on the shelves at the local express auto store, these rhino ramps are of exceptional quality. users will notice that each ramp feels very solid / stable with rubber stops on the underside (to help reduce the likelihood of each slipping).i read some reviews stating that these ramps worked well for [even] lowered vehicles. those claims are true depending on how far out your front bumper is from the front wheels. my vehicle (vw r) has a little over "" of clearance [from ground to front lip]. these rhino ramp 's are still too tall to allow my vehicle from rolling up without the use of additional extensions.- stars for being somewhat inconvenient in that the two ramps can not be stacked or stored with a minimal footprint.",1

"i bought this to improve the quality of my headlight covers as they were cloudy and my visibility was getting more and more limited. it works very well and is easy to use, however, if your headlamp covers are very cloudy it will take you several applications to get enough improvement. it is fairly straightforward, just apply a small amount with a soft cloth and then buff off with a clean cloth. the only issue i had with this product is that after being on the shelf for a few months it separated with an oily mass on top. it wasn't that easy to shake and get it re-blended either. i mean, it really took a long time to get it to remix. it is worth it, though! it increased the lighting by quite a bit and i passed the bottle around to all my friends with the same issue and they brought it back with a big smile on their faces! inexpensive fix for a major safety problem.",1
