"what is deplicted in the picture of the product is not what you'll receive. the picture is of a male fitting that is screwed onto the dual hose air chuck so the chuck can be attached to an air hose. btw, the star rating is for the dual hose air chuck and not the fitting.",0
the product was great. it had a nice thick color. i imagine application would be very convenient and easy. but only thing was wrong was the actual color. turns out my car is not orient metallic blue but some gray color which means i wasted much needed money.,0
i was happy with the service and condition of the kit i have not used it yet but we will see,0
"this was not why i expected. i thought it would be an easy gadget, but it was not. it doesn't even have an on/off button. the turntable never worked. the instructions suggest what u need to do should the turntable not spin. i didn't even try it, just a waste of time. amazon's return policy makes it so easy to return the item back that i have no regrets on getting it as long as it was from amazon.",0
one of the springs was not attached the lock-out would'nt disengauge for somthing this expensive you would think it would be right.,0
i really hope i never have to use this item. it is something you do not want to spend money on but do not want to wish you had it when you need it. it seems sturdy and like it could do the job it is designed to do.,0
"great product so far. bought it back in november and hasn't shown any problems. easy to install alsoit kind of sucks that it only has one wiper blade when are shown so it threw me off a little. plus, i didn't know that my car had different sizes for driver side and passenger side.",0
i was hoping to find this item with either a lower price for its torque or higher torque for its price.,0
"my computer [brand new gateway tablet w/ vista and plenty of power] had a hard time registering this microphone even when it was on full volume. for kicks, i tried the speech recognition with the gateway's built in mic and it did just as good [poor] a job!! if you really need to dictate, stay away from this waste of money!!",0
"if you want your engine to be louder, then this is for you. dyna testing shows no increase of horse power and a honda tech told me this would be cheaper to manufacture than the stock air intake they make for your engine. i spent alot of time and money on my stereo, so im not interested in hearing my engine. if sound is what your after then get this.",0
"i used this product on an ikea pigmented/finshed leather couch and it did not condition it at all. the couch started to crack and peel after a few months of use after applying this product. there were no signs of cracking or peeling before. i think, this product may have hastened it by actually drying the leather. i'd stick to a real leather conditioner than this all-in-one cleaner/conditoner. why still the two stars? to be fair, i never used it for car leather upholstery, for which it is targetted for.",0
"well, i can't say much because i havn't fully installed this alarm system but when i first recieved this package i thought of two things:. they sent me the instead of the .....the has more features so i guess thats my gain.. it's much more complex than it looks.it looks like something that has a few connections and boom, it's ready. not at all. you have to mount the siren, whcih i'm having trouble doing because everything is in the way.when i fully install this alarm system (which may take me a couple days or so), i'll write a full review on it.",0

i don't have this but just wondering how it doesn't fit. both the pcxp and the back plate use / accessories. should definitely fit.,0
"don't be mislead by it's sleak size and look, the first thing you'll miss is no number pad, just the numbers across the top. the keys are low set, so it's very easy to hit something wrong, but, by far, the worst is that the keyboard will not put the numbers(and sometimes letters) where you want them, and put them in places like the address bar, or any open box above the address bar, and even take you completely out of your program, or back to it's home page (at the very least)now it does not always do this,but it does it a lot,and mostly when you are in the middle of important work. it will drive you nuts re-doing your work multiple times, so in general don't let it's good looks fool you. i think ms has more work to do on this keyboard",0
"we had high hopes for this professional-sounding adhesive. but after a week, the headliner was hanging loose again. looks like we're off to the upholstry shop.",0
"i have not had a chance to test the unit properly yet but i am sure it will be good. the purchase price is listed at $.. a fee of $. is added for postage and fees, this was not mentoned. it takes weeks to arrive and then the post office charges . vat and handling fee. no doubt i will have a credit card fee as well. might as well have bought it in uk.",0
item arrived on time in new condition. have not had a chance to test it. the only test could be someone trying to steal the trailer. it looks strong though.,0
igloo has free shipping but the front is faux metal (silver plastic). if i had to do it over again i'd get the emerson (stainless front)emerson -bottle wine cooler - stainless steel-- $ shipping to nj. also the temp indicator is off; setting the unit to degrees yields degree wine --actron cp pockettherm infrared thermometer. i believe the pockettherm to be correct as it determined ice water to be / degrees.,0
so this sat around for awhile before i used it and sure enough i go to use it and the top of the unopen tube is hardened and unuse able this is bs and i cant even retuen it,0
"i wasn't happy at all with this item because when i tried to burn movies into this blank dvds, some of them did not work! i completely wasted about blank dvds. they did not work properly. i would recommend others to use different dvds.",0

"if you are looking for headlights for vw jetta , do not buy it!!it is my first time writing a review. when i received this stuff. i was very happy. so i tried to install it. i tried many times. but i couldn't put it in the hole which holds headlights. finally, i found this hella headlight is a little longer than my original one although the model number is exactly the same . what can i do now?? now i opened the box.so i lost this bucks......i will not buy any parts on the internet. i will directly go to the dealer's shop although it is expensive.",0
"who ever heard of a refrigerator with no on/off switch and no thermostat?this is especially important when it's running on the same battery that will be used to start the car. why run the battery down when it's ""cool enough"" inside?koolatron does offer models with thermostats but they were not displayed when i was searching for this and bought it. when i contacted them about the parts their answer was, ""unfortunately, the thermister wires have to be installed at the time the cooling unit is put into place. otherwise, it will not be properly done. we do not make those parts available to customers for that reason."" who knows, maybe i would have gotten it right? certainly would have been better that the amateur thermostat i installed.the good news is that the product works and does what i want. shame on koolatron for lousy marketing and service. tsk, tsk...",0
"highly overrated tool. doesn't even come close to the torque specs advertised by milwaukee. it can take out bolts torqued to about ft/lb.that is the closest it will come to ft/lb? false advertising at the finest by milwaukee. don't buy this tool, if you think you can use it for anything over ft/lb.stay away, far away, not even close!",0
"i'm glad that i had the money to buy the merchandise. everyone should invest into car alarm systems because at this point, people are stealing and you don't know what people will be doing in the future. it was a good buy and i am very pleased with my purchase. thank you for making an affordable purchase!",0
"there is a little metal tooth thing inside this monkey that looks like it wants you to touch it, but if you pry the top off with a wrench and stick body parts in there to touch it, you better be grounded buddy because you're in for the ride of your life. this thing must have a jiggawatt capacitor in there or something because i blacked out and didn't wake up for hours after touching it, and it wasn't even plugged in at the time. i can't stop blinking lately either. be careful when dissecting this little tazer-wannabe!!!",0
i own the fuji s and e both are . megs. i also just purchased the sony dsc-p (. megs) i took pictures using each camera using the settings all set to auto. the pictures were from close up to max zoom. i then had the best of each camera enlarged to in. by in. at costco high end fuji processor. the fuji colors were rich and not actual colors.the sony p- was more true to actual color. both sony and fuji were about the same in detail of the subject and were intuitive to operate plus fast to start up. i was looking for a smaller compact camera and the sony is the best small and yet very good quality pictures. the fuji has a optical and excellent body shape. when i viewed the dscv . i was disapointed at how slow the start up was. for that reason i decided not to buy the dscv. my nikon mm is still way ahead in detail quality/color for enlagements!,0

"i think this player is amazingly priced when you consider that is has hdmi output and multi-channel sacd support. maybe this person does not want these features, but samsung's hdmi (not dvi) i player is similarly priced. when it comes down to it, the upscaled hdtv picture quality is what will show whether this player is any good.hdtv upscaling can have lots of artifacts or inaccuracies. i'm guessing sony is working on these problems with this new player.this player is not released as of the time of this writing.",0
"the thing looks fine and everything, but it is supposed to convert the trailer socket. so why does it have a -pin flat vehicle connector?i already have one of those, coming from my vehicle. so therefore, they won't plug into each other (like a male-male plug).look at the diagrams on this page if you don't know what i'm talking about:[..]so i'm kind of wondering how all the other star reviewers here figured that out. this thing is a - pin flat vehicle connector. it should be a trailer connector. what gives?",0
i was really excited to get this lense. i have just recently got into photography. i was not disappointed. works great from what i can tell.....not a pro by any means but does what i need it to do.,0
this range just does not seem to have a really good lens on the market right now and hopefully one of the companies who makes k mount lenses will do something about the problem. if i had it to do again i would buy a fixed lens at or in a manual focus lens.,0
"this is advertised loud and clear as the oz bottle. however, when i opened the box, it was oz. i don't know who to blame, royalpurple.com or amazon.com.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------the vendor has updated the listing and now it shows the oz bottle instead of oz. they also explained the difference of the upgraded oz version with the old oz version in the comment area of my initial review. i accept that. so, i edited my review. thanks for the response. however, the engine of my car has been as hot as before, and i didn't observe any drop in temparature. as such, i only upgraded the -star rating to -star rating. //",0

"this product is high quality, i have a honda vtlx cc and the product looks very well. i have problems with the installation delate aprox hour because the seat was very complicate to reinstall. the manual installation is no very clear, but a the end i am happy with the product, i bought the large size and i think if you have many things to carry the extra large is better.i recomend to the manufactures add a lock key for the bags and the zippers, then if you leave your moto outside in any place you don't have to worry about thiefs.",0

works good for turning vinyl looking new but supposed to clean as well? i could have rubbed with plain water and got same results as far as cleaning goes. not worth the money if you are looking for protection and cleaning both. dh- is misleading cause it's not uv but maybe closer to uv- rating? i gave it below average cause it's supposed to do both clean and protect and jury still out on protect.good luck,0

"this is an okay waste container, but i found that it was not worth it to me to pay this much for something which has similar competition for less money. i bought it for two daughters as well as myself, and they were underwhelmed. it is good if you tend to toss wet trash in a waste recepticle and don't want leakage, but beyond that it is not worth the price. it won't tip over, which is good, but i would hope that by the time someone is middle-aged like me, they would know how to handle garbage without making a huge mess in the car.",0
"well, even though i heard that sennheiser is high end and top of the line etc. here's my feedback:nice and warm music but the huge headphones can get hot and sweaty!! the noise cancelling type is smaller and doesn't get hot.the other issue is that there are days where the cordless is terrible in picking up the signal for a station!!so, it is a compromise...you want cordless for the freedom of not having a cord (very restrictive) there is downside.",0
"este producto es muy delicado y se da&ntilde;o con poco uso, aunque tenia a&ntilde;o y meses con el, lo use muy poco y ya se me da&ntilde;o sin dejarlo caer, sin mojarlo, no entiendo como un producto tan caro , porque solo por ser marca nikon , ya hay que pagar por el nombre, es tan caro y de tan poca duracion. comprare otra marca para mi camara nikon d-, en verdad el dinero no sobra y por eso no lo recomiendo.",0

"looking for a quick point/shoot to go with my olympus e/, i bought the cx. i shot a few pics and was not disappointed at all by the image quality. however the light weight and cheap plastic feel really got to me. so i returned it for a canon a and very glad i did. if you don't mind the disposable camera feel get the kodak for the image quality.",0

"cyrus chestnut is a wonderful young talent and this cd showcases him terrifically. i strongly disagree with a previous reviewer that this is even close to easy listening. first, cyrus plays extremely aggressively. without ever losing his touch he bangs the heck out of the keyboard on some selections. this is, after all a trio (which is joined by a saxophonist on three songs that all work). the trio is a classic jazz lineup and sometimes, it is exactly what you want to hear. this cd rewards on the first listening and is still pleasing me!",0
"first i will complain about how much i hate it when a company takes their floor display and reboxes it to send you as new. i had to wash the bonnet before use because it was dirty and wet wipe the handle. just because we buy over the internet does not mean you can treat us as second class shoppers. that being said here is my review.my stars only refers to the product after its first use. used it on my lanai(patio) windows and it was quite clumsy to manuver. it made a water mess unless you tried to squeeze out the excess water which is difficult. i haven't tried it on my car yet that is coming soon, then i will update. it may have a user learning period but at first try ""user friendly"" is not its nickname.",0

this charger charges my two harleys. that's about all i can say. i wish it was little better made. they made the shell out of cheap plastic. if it was made with a metal or heavy plastic case it would have made me feel better about spending the cash.,0
i ordered two of these filters. the packaging was safe and nice with more than enough padding in the box. however both of the filters were defective with top of the metal cans were bent.i returned them for a refund.metal endcaps on both sides makes the total filtering area smaller than equivalent toyota filters.maybe a reason to use the bigger size.,0

after seeing all of the reviews i thought that this would be great for recording lectures for school. ii gets great sound even in big lecture halls and recording and deleting a file is easy. however to work the other bells and whistles the directions didn't make much sence to me. even with trying to follow the pictures and the writen instructions step by step i just couldn't figure it out. so is it really worth the money? no not really.,0

amazon is hit or miss on the items they sell. probably % of the items they sell are returns or refurbished. read the reviews on other products. it is hard for me to say that they do not know this. i am sure they do. if you return the first you are guaranteed to get a know one. i believe they dump the old before they send the new. its systematic and calculative. this product was sent back and refurbished. i am sure they have a company that does it. then they recycled this stuff to the public.,0

let me start by saying that i've never been upside down in a submerged car trying to cut my seatbelt off and shatter the window to get out but if i was there are better safety hammers/tools on the market. this one is lightweight and reminds me of a toy. i'm afraid it would break before the window would. it does have a sharp point and cutting edge both untried by me. it just doesn't instill confidence. look elsewhere and spend a little more for the real thing.,0

"i tried repairing the headliner while it was still in the car, and it didn't go very well. it was the headliner along the edge of the back window, so when i sprayed it, the glue would form droplets that trickled down to where the headliner was still attached, and they soaked through. now the headliner has yellow glue splotches on it. also, because it's a spray, it's hard to spray it evenly over all areas. so there are still areas that are detached. and i couldn't get all the bubbles out either. i should have just had it done professionally, which is what i have to do now to fix the mess i made.",0

"purchased the solar battery charger to keep a lawn mower charged while out on my lawn. the manual says that it should not be used outdoors, and not come in contact with water. not sure what the purpose of this product is then, and page manual provides zero information. upon opening the packaging, the top and bottom part of the plastic case were coming apart, and there was no gasket in between the two plastic parts (one reason i guess it is not waterproof). connected it up, and left it charge for a couple weeks. the plastic case had already melted in several locations, and the wires to the battery had cracked (bad strain reliefs). i have ended up just throwing this away. it is inexpensive, but you pay for what you get with this product. perhaps i got a bad product, but not willing to try another one.",0

"although i cannot comment on the quality of the product since i did not open the packaging, it did arrive from amazon quickly with the appearance of being a reasonably good angled feeler gauge. the only problem is that the gauges started at . and went up from there. so if you have a honda, toyota, misubishi or an import car with a smaller double overhead cam engine you probably will not get the gauges you need to do a valve adjustment. i have a honda vtec and needed .-. intake and . -. exhaust so this gauge was basically useless to me. amazon or the distributor should have listed the gauges on the description and most of the descriptions do not. amazon does make it easy to do returns and will refund my money along with the shipping fees, so this is going back. craftsman has a unit feeler gauge that had all the gauges needed for my car and motorcycle.",1

"i read all the other reviews- and they are all pretty dead on. this is the first beaded cover ive owned and i do like it- but it is waaay to small. i drive a tiny car (hyundai accent) and the seat cover just does not fit. please dont be fooled by the product image- the perspective is way off. the narrow part is much longer than it appears- and one of the pictures submitted by 'reviewers' has got to be on a fake car seat. there is no way this product would cover a seat as shown. i put up some pictures of it in my car for comparison. also the tie downs are flimsy (like everyone warned) and im just merely making-do with it for now.that said, it is better than nothing and seems to be pretty durable, given that it has been hanging from my headrest for a month- and let's face it- the price is good- especially with free shipping...",1

"this is a great panel to have, if you take good care of it. in full sunlight, it will put out the full watts and is fully weatherproof. it is not heavy duty though, so you cant just have it somewhere it might slip, or have it angled up with the chance of it falling down--because it will break. and you can't fix the glass in it if you take it apart. even when broken it still puts out the watts, it just needs to be kept weather safe.i got it at amazon's lowest price ever and i saw they went back up. but i would have already got another at that same price i got the first.this watt panel is the perfect size to charge batteries without a controller.",1
"for whatever reason, this stuff wasn't the oxidation miracle i was hoping for. i didn't throw the easiest job in the world at it--granted. i was trying to improve the appearance of an older oxidized black car roof. i went over it about times as directed with tr and appearance was only moderately improved.even the final finish on areas of the paint that were in good shape didn't have the glossy sheen i was hoping for when finished.i've had much better luck with turtle wax color back on oxidation than this product--and i don't think anyone hails that as a top-shelf solution.in general i simply wasn't impressed. i guess it works a little--or maybe it works really well on new car finishes that are in very good shape. kind of don't know why i didn't have the same great experience as everyone else...",1

"i was relatively satisfied with this leather conditioner, my couches definitely felt softer after the application and restored some of their luster. i did however feel like a little bit of waxy residue was left behind and wasn't sure if it would get on my clothes or not. a month after treatment, the luster has begun to fade and may need a follow-up treatment sooner than the recommended month interval. i did clean beforehand with lexol's leather cleaner. my impression is that the conditioner is partially absorbed by the leather, but also leaves a thin wax-like coating. i would have been more satisfied if the conditioner was absorbed more deeply into the leather.",1

"i dont think you can find a better meter for $. i have a couple of these meters because i prefer to use these instead of my fluke out int he field since i find my self dropping my multimeters or loosing them. these meters dont seem to be too accurate for measuring small values since the reading on the screen when nothing is being tested is sometimes as high as mv but if you dont need to be too precise then this meter would be fine. also it takes awhile for the reading to steady, when measuring resistance the meter bounces about or times before it settles on a reading.",1
"although i feel i will get years of use out of this product, there are a few items that disappointed me:. instructions are incomplete. for the most part the instructions are clear, but they left off the final step of putting the last piece on the cart. not a big deal - anyone should be able to figure it out.. delivery - took over a month to get the product (backordered twice).. assembly - instruction say not to use power screwdriver so as not to overtighten screws. you will wear out your wrists if you assemble this manually.. sturdiness - i waxed cars the weekend this arrived. i found that it moved quite easily and was very comfortable, but my lb body caused the seat to sag. i was expecting it to be much sturdier - especially for this price.. storage - the storage areas are really too small to be useful unless used for small hardware (screwdrivers, small wrenches, nuts, etc.). not big enough for power tools.",1
"i do not drive in the snow very often at all. i have a large suv that is not x, so i purchased these just in case on our utah trip. i did end up needing the cable-chains. they were very simple to use. not having to run them over in order to put them on was the greatest invention ever! i did not rinse them off for three days after i took them off, and within that delay they got a lot of rust on them. i don't know if that's normal or not?? i sprayed wd on them and put them away.",1

i purchased two of these bicycle type wheels for a garden cart i was building. i had a / inch cold roll steel bar for an axle and these wheels fit fine. these aren't some cheap thin wall tires on the rim. both tire and rim are heavy duty. very pleased with this purchase. if you are building your own garden cart this wheels are top choice.,1
"i initially purchased the power supply to test some electrical stuff that i am working on, but found that it is a very robust unit, able to do more than simply check to see if relays or horns are working. currently, i have the unit hooked up to a electrolytic rust removal tank in place of a battery charger that i was using. the unit has been putting out power to the tank for three days straight, with no signs of overheating at all.i would recommend this unit very highly. perhaps the only thing that i feel the unit could use is an amp meter in the face of the machine. i know the more expensive units have this, but i just thought it would be a nice addition.hopefully this review gave you some idea of my experience with this unit.",1

"unlike some of the other reviews, this one is specific to this product and to the point. i've used these cables for over a year on my saturn in big bear, ca. installation is pretty easy with just a little practice. no readjusting after installation; a real plus. be careful not to spin the tire on acceleration; the hook on the inside can release and the chain will pop off. the rubber tightener is cracked, but has not broken; makes me nervous. the traction coils are wearing well, even with quite a lot of bare-pavement driving. the side cables appear to be untwisting, making the whole unit prone to knotting itself up and more difficult to install, (after a lot of use.) these cables have destroyed my plastic hub caps. despite some problems, these cables are superior to conventional chains and i would buy them again.",1
"this exhause tip needs better information on the size of the incoming tailpipe. my tail pipe is "" and you would think this would fit but it didn't. the internal dimension of this tip is /"" so the tip would actually constrict the flow of exhaust in my case, and it couldn't even be attached with the bolt on adapters. the product itself is excellent if the correct sizing information was supplied so you could make an intelligent buying decision.",1

"i have had the q-tower system for a number of years, through three different vehicles. all in all a great rack system, except for two items: the cost of the little parts that you need to convert from one vehicle to the other are stratospheric! i really don't mind yakima making their money on the big ticket items such as towers, boxes, etc. but the little adapter items should be priced more fairly. it seems to me that once you are locked into a yakima system they fully intend to hose you on the little things. too bad. further, the yakima website is a mess to try and find the specific little items and accessories that they intend on hosing you with!",1
"i have one of these power inverters for those instances (about times/year)of power losses from rain- or snow-storms. between my car, the car battery and the power inverter, i have the equivalent of a generator. be sure to determine the wattage of the electrical devices that will be powered. a &quot;-tv will require about watts; floor- or desk lamps require about watts each; a laptop computer needs about watts. a -cuft side-by-side refrigerator uses about kilowatt-hours per year (about watts average; watts &quot;surge&quot; when the compressor kicks in )",1
"at $ it was a great price with free super saver shipping. they are delicate panels. the plastic around one of them already broke when it hit - below zero. i am waiting to see what happens next. the charger is very cheapo and delays the charge, but this was explained in the item description. it will run a boat trolling motor just fine on a sunny day hooked directly to the motor. can't complain too much, unless the glass starts beaking too. the solar panels themselves are super delicate and break very easily. wind will blow the thing over with just a breeze. quality doesn't come cheap. it's a great starter if you are looking to experiment into solar energy like me. i use it to light my chickens coops.",1
"multimeter is ok. if you want to measure low voltages or continuity, make sure to replace the probes first. there is something wrong with the metal coating of probe tips. you have to press the metal tips hard to hear the buzzer. after i replaced the probes there was no problem.i suspect the metal plating of the probe tips is improperly formulated. it probably suffers from some type of oxide forming on them that has poor conductivity. you can rub, but it immediately forms again due to the exposure to air.",1
well... i bought this duster with a bit of skepticism... having just bought a new car! it works very well when you literally have a light dusting to remove... which is what i was looking for... for in between car washes!,1
"i bought this to cover my stove downstairs which i rarely use. with this i gain extra counter space which i use to put my juicer, and other kitchen gadgets on. i should've bought this long ago so that i don't need to cram all my kitchen gadgets in the cabinets which you end up forgetting about.only con that i see is that it doesn't fit the standard stove perfectly",1
"we purchased this for going camping. it is well designed. and i would say well made even though we did have one issue where a seam came apart on us after the second use but thule was real good about replacing it. (that seam is why instead of stars)we've been using it for about years now, and even traveled in the rain with it and everything stayed nice a dry inside.the best part for me is since it is fabric it can give in places when needed so bulkier items can still fit. unlike fixed-sized fiberglass clam shells. the down side is that fiberglass ones are more aerodynamic therefore better on gas then this.but it's give and take... i would definitely recommend this.",1
"i made sure to read the reviews before i actually bought these & i was a little nervous about how hk gets so dirty. i am a neat freak lol. and yes, they do get dirty fast. however, i found a way to get them clean. bleach water.spray that on there, let it sit a minute & either wipe it off with a paper towel or spray it with the hose, they look like new. so don't let that turn you off from buying them. they're super cute! i got the matching steering wheel cover & i get so many comments on how cute my car is. :)",1

"well, it works as expected. hit it with psi and it'll pull all the oil out of an oil pan or antifreeze out of a block. because it drafts through the dipstick tube, the draft tubes are rather small which translates to a fairly lengthy evacuation time. for my .l capacity engine, it took about minutes to completely empty. and that's getting nearly .l out, which is pretty empty! properly cleaning the tank is a little cumbersome because of all the bolts on the lid. i like my equipment really clean when i'm through with it so i actually unbolt the top and clean and wipe the inside. probably not necessary for most folks - a good rinsing with a solvent would suffice - but manageable nonetheless. overall, i'm very pleased with the evacuator and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to remove a drain plug ever again.",1
"pros: very compact and portable; able to usually power my hp laptop; long'ish power cord; easy to use.cons: ) it has a little cooling fan that is slightly noisy and runs almost continuously. highway road noise mostly masks the noise. ) sometimes the inverter would blink a red light and temporarily suspend power output. maybe it was too hot powering my hp laptop. according to kill-o-watt, my laptop usually draws only about watts, or about watts when also recharging the battery. ) it sometimes smells a little bit like burnt plastic.overall, i am satisfied with this inverter for the money spent. if i had to buy another, i'd probably get something with a little more power. however, my honda civic has a limit of watts for dc accessories. the watt inverter i used to have blew the fuse. check your auto owner's manual for the power limit before you buy.",1
we started with this one but were loathe to drill into the door to secure it. we tried double sided tape but the plastic was warped and curved and would not stay. this product is cheap (in every sense). it does not hold that many bags and is a bit of a pain to use since it does not hold that much and you really have to push and pull to get the bags in and out. we replaced it with a metal version that hangs over the top of the door and is working much better.,1
looks good but item is bumper only no tire carrier as pictured. amazon said everything in picture but not the case.,1
"i bought this power inverter specifically for camping (ie blowing up our air mattress, etc.). i haven't put it through any heavy loads or rigorous testing but it works great for our needs. it's very compact and so it easily fits in a small space in my car. for the amount of power it puts out and the cost it was a great investment.",1

"heininger's advantage adjustable hitch extension works as described. it was used with a rack on the rear of an rv to accompany three bikes (for adult and children). installation was relatively simple, and the product proved sturdy for the weight of the bicycles.since the hitch extension was used on the back of a recreational vehicle, it was difficult to determine if wobbliness occurred. however, we only noticed slight vibration from the rear window when driving over uneven terrain.",1
a good product that works as advertised. only two problems () the cord for the transformer to the keyboard is too short. unless i drill a hole in my desk (which is shallow) the cord pulls the keyboard back to the edge of the shelf.

i purchased the porter cable because i have had good luck with their products in the past and was impressed with the extra torque this wrench had.but when i opened the box i found the tool with scuff marks and sitting in a small puddle of oil. i am doubtful if the leaking oil condition would improve with use and did not want the risk of messing up my tool chest considering this model does not come with case (model with case was discontinued per toolcribb). i will be returning product and trying another brand.well i didn't return it. it works fine with a little weepage of oil. not sure if still sold but it has held up in my garage with occasional use for a long time now.,1

"unlike the horror stories i've heard elsewhere regarding battery damage during shipping, my battery arrived (upside down!) in undamaged condition. there aren't many auto batteries that can boast that. after removing the original battery i cleaned up the corroded battery terminals with an acid-neutralizing spray. the new optima battery dropped straight in and i clamped it down using the original clamp and bolt. this battery fitted very nicely into my vw gti .t, no modifications required. i now have confidence in cranking the engine on those bitter winter mornings. the only negative is the price compared to similar capacity batteries and the shortish warranty. hence the stars. all in all, a good product and i'm happy with my purchase so far.",1
"got two of them month ago and set it up through a whole day. it really took me some time to figure out the right wire, because the diagram on their website is not so accurate for one of my car.(for avalon, the color of the wire for the door is not right). but once i set it up, it worked perfectly. i can control it at about feet away from it. although it's not feet, it is good enough. i gave it stars only because it is not as easy as what i thought to set it up, but maybe it is different in your case, depends on how good you are at electrics. :-)",1

"i've had one of these for over a year. although it is advertised as being brightly colored for visibility, it can't been seen once you start into the garage because it's below the driver's field of vision. but it does help placement of the car and, as long as speed is slow, it's easy enough to stop once you feel that first bump. it stays in place most of the time. driving onto the tongue of the mat keeps it in place under the weight of the car. but in wet conditions, as the mat dries, it may stick a bit to the tire and be pulled out of position as the car is later backed off the mat. fortunately we can usually feel that happen and can place it back into position. to facilitate this, i recommend putting a small mark on the garage floor once you know where you want the mat.",1
"with a name like ""xl"" i expected this to be bigger when it first came. however, after having used it now for months, it really holds a lot. it works perfectly in our minivan (fits right under the middle console table) and the weighted plus velcro on the bottom does a great job holding it in place. we never use the lid but it's nice to know its there in case we need it.",1
"i read (and re-read) the instructions that came with this unit and in one section it has instructions to 'not' attach the clips directly to one post of the battery, but instead to have a length of wire attached to one of the posts if the battery is out of the vehicle. later instructions don't say this. it's simple enough to attach one of the alligator clips to a ground on a battery installed in the vehicle, but i find it ridiculous to suggest that i need to attach a ""jumper cable"" to a battery outside of a vehicle, just to charge it.the leads (alligator and other) are just too short. another inches would have made them more usable.i do like that it fully charges the battery ad then goes in to a maintenance mode. i can leave it attached for a couple days without worrying about it.",1
"the easy quick jumper is a cinch to use, but may not actually take less time than the tried and true conventional jumper cables. ok, sure you don't have to open the hood, but it actually takes anywhere from - minutes to charge up the battery in the dead car enough to start the vehicle. if you're in a hurry and feel confident in knowing what you are doing, jumper cables are the way to go. however if you want something that's safe, easy and are willing to allow a few extra minutes, the easy quick jumper is not a bad alternative and works extremely well.",1
very disapointed. it did the job but leaked terribly at the joints. i tried adding multiple washers at the joints and it did not help. the soap dispenser leaked teribbly also. won't buy another. i would ask for my money back but i did use it.,1
"i purchased the coleman ceramic heater due to a problem with my car which doesn't allow us to use the heat or defrost. i was very disappointed when i plugged in the product and no heat was given off at all, just a weak stream of cool air. i figured initially that the car must need to be warmed up but unfortunately, the heat was not affected by the engine warming up at all. neither levels of airflow produced heat. i suppose there is a chance that we received a faulty product or there was a problem with our cigarette lighter (although it definitely had power). i hope you have a better experience with this product. i was pleased with the speed in which autobarn returned our money, even if we did lose a good portion of the return for shipping costs.",1
"after owning a number of simple and fancy tire gauges, i purchased a few different styles from milton, a us company with a long heritage. after finding that i got different readings measuring the pressure in the same tire, i contacted milton and spoke with a fellow there who said that in the us, even the best gauge only has to be within pounds of the actual pressure. that was a little disappointing, noting that one can be low and another high for a spread of pounds on a tire that has a pound spec. when i complained about this, he said the important thing is to keep the tires inflated, and to the same pressure in each tire. he added, being off a few pounds is not a problem. i find that hard to believe with all of the safety warnings to inflate tires to the spec.",1
"this product is great! it allows you to stick stuff you either dont have room for in your car, or dont want in your car, pretty much on your rear bumper.fits like the description says.does what its designed to do.this product is not a heavy duty item. i am somewhat skeptical of the mesh on the bottom. however, i have loaded this bad johnny up with a medium duty rototiller and no problems.my only gripe is that it gets surface rust in a few spots. i would reccomend a better paint job, or paint it yourself.",1
i bought this a year back. it worked great for year. i always use this whenever i go for trips. it still works without any problem except it recently started giving some noise(probably because of the fan).you can definetely get irritated unless you have music on with good volume.,1

"i purchased these ramps after reading a number of positive reviews online. unlike some of the cheap looking variants sitting on the shelves at the local express auto store, these rhino ramps are of exceptional quality. users will notice that each ramp feels very solid / stable with rubber stops on the underside (to help reduce the likelihood of each slipping).i read some reviews stating that these ramps worked well for [even] lowered vehicles. those claims are true depending on how far out your front bumper is from the front wheels. my vehicle (vw r) has a little over "" of clearance [from ground to front lip]. these rhino ramp 's are still too tall to allow my vehicle from rolling up without the use of additional extensions.- stars for being somewhat inconvenient in that the two ramps can not be stacked or stored with a minimal footprint.",1
"we got this because we were renting a car to go over the hill, over the day,to grandmother's house for christmas. rental in mind, i got this for it's ""universal"" factor. the rack worked great and did not cause any damage to the rental car, *but*...it appears the word ""universal"" is synonymous with ""rain gutters"". this is the reason we don't have a full compliment of stars. oh, and if you're wondering how i got the rack on without the benefit of rain gutters...yeah...um...(close your ears rent-a-car places), i ran a tie-down line through the car with the doors open and ratcheted it down, then closed the doors on the line. a bit noisy due to the wind whistling through the lines as well as the gap in the door, but we got to grandma's and back without a hitch.",1
"i use this product to paint the threads of a multi-part steel crucible that is inserted into a molten lead solder bather for up to minutes at a time, at temperatures of - degrees celsius. it works well to prevent most seizing, although as the product is used and you start to get down to the last amounts, it will start drying out and become a bit less effective. i recommend keeping the lid on and tightly closed when not in use.",1

"the product works as advertised. however, it occasionally emits a high pitched sound which i identified as a hardware issue with the mini fan which resides in the unit. something is loose: either the case that holds the unit together or the mini fan inside. after i fumble around with the unit for a minute i get the sound to go away. but it's annoying to have to do this. i have only used the unit a few times so far. perhaps the noise will go away entirely...or it might come back and never go away. so i remain concerned. when the unit isn't hissing at me, it's great.",1
"just got it today. tried to start the car with it, but it wasn't enough juice, so i waited about three minutes with it set on a engine start mode. started it successfully after that. ran the car for minutes. turned off the engine and tried to start the car without the device. success. now it's charging in the garage. looks good so far. i agree with the previous review that the extension cord is too short.",1
i recieved the order a lot quicker than expected. seat covers were very difficult to put on and the directions weren't very helpful or clear so i ended up putting them on which ever way they fit the best. they didn't fit the seats on my ford focus very well but after a week or so they began to stretch and fit better.,1

"when i purchased this solar panel kit, i was not expecting anything fantastic out of it since the panels were low output and-quite frankly-cheap. when i used them to charge a low capacity v battery, which is really supposed to be used as a motorcycle starter battery, it charged it in about - hours in strong sunlight. it is definitely not the highest output, but i have been charging my cell phone from that same battery charge for quite some time now, it works for the purposes it is stated. i saw the panels measure up to about v in strong sun, but the current was unable to be measured on my ammeter (likely because it is too small). this product is great for starters and it provides a cheap but effective way to familiarize oneself with solar panel kits before going into bigger purchases. i would recommend this for casual use, but probably not as a heavy-duty power supply.",1
"the tool delivers on all of its functional promises - effective glass hammer, belt cutter and it's at the ready! i would suggest buying some adhesive velcro or some double-stick tape to mount it to the underside of your automobile dashboard. mount it under the steering wheel, and you'll always know where to find it.",1
