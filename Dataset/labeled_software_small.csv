"amazon needs to provide a track listing for this e.p., and i, alas, am unable to do so and will thus be considered unhelpful, though that's more their fault than mine. but of the song which gives this disc its name, i can only say: ""yeah, we're wating around... uh huh.. we ain't doing anything... oh yeah, waiting on our butts... oh yeah..."" ..... nice inspiring anthem, ya fool!",0
"warning!!!! if you purchase this product you can run it on one and only one machine. for example if you have a laptop and desktop you may only install it on one of the two machines. if you try to install it on both the update feature will no longer work. when you contact trendmicro they will inform you that you will need to buy another complete copy of the software to use it on both machines. talk about gouging your customer!!!! there is no reason for trendmicro to treat &quot;home&quot; users in this way. the vast majority of software companies allow a product to be used on multiple machines as long as it is by the same user.as for the product itself, it works well.",0
"this movie started the trend of video game movies that were actually good...sadly a small trend. this movie did the best they could with the material they got. unlike its horrible sequel. they used the characters good, not too many or with horrible acting.now the reason i didnt give this a perfect score is simple. its not perfect, they did some major changes to the storyline especially to that of scorpion and sub-zero hatred towards each other. its only mentioned once by shang tsung as them being bitter rivals.another good aspect was how they did goro. i still dont know how they did it.buy this moviepros:-did the best they could-gorocons:-change of pace of storyline",0

"i think that this is and ok program but not a very powerful one. if you wont a powerful program go to this web site www.imagener.com/se/gc and get a program called kneson imagener and you can get it in pro or standard version. and adobe photoshop i rate it a / and the kneson imagener a / .so, go and get kneson imagener now,before its to late!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
auto run failed on two new cd's & i was given by best buy store norton av that worked fine. see my children's review for more stuff.,0
"why? sumantec include less funtions in this version of norton utilities? if you compare the norton y k and the norton y k+ you see the first one have a lot of funtions and scans (harward scan, etc..) and the second one do not include all of that (more new with less funtions) plus of that if you have the black ice installed the program do not work properly, well i think is better you see if you really need this product before because the funtions it have are great but maybe your system can work with the las version",0
"i really like norton internet security.he's really on the ball.i have it set to let me know if anyone tries to access my computer,and it does a great job.i was quite surprised to find out how many times a day my internet security was compromised!it was worth every cent!i would recommend it to anyone!",0

"i'm fully on vista x now, except for quicktime and starry night. in fact since running vista as one of the beta testers, the only bsods i've ever received were from quicktime and starry night!i've used starry night on xp, where it works fine. the only problem is, i don't run xp any more. i'd give it stars (the ui is waaaay too quirky, in my opinion -- too much java under the covers), except that i can't run it at the moment.",0
"unfortunately i am not too pleased with this product because it seems to have adversely affected my mac. i have been unable to get msn messenger and my online access has slowed down & my primary email has taken on all sorts of weird quirks.perhaps it's just too much product for me. i am a luddite in these matters so i'm not the best person to ask.i can, however access more attachments, files etc so i'll reserve final judgement",0
"first micro soft office profrofessional is a star. it's to bad that windows vista isn't. anyone developeing software especially a new operating system, should have taken the time to include drivers for all audio and printers etc.it is faster on my machine but i only see some bells and whistles that have been used from other sources added into windows. security is good but very anoying with those popup windows. i uninstalled it and went back to windows xp pro...................:(",0

"whos mainly doing live recordings will be frustrated with this application. first it needs a lot of time yet to find out how to make a simple recording, because there are several steps to take. maybe its a good application for djs, i dont know because i am not into this, but as a simple recording program i would recommend garageband - i do classic music ensemble recording with multitrack overdub and was always frustrated with the confusing interface of ableton live. i just want to open a program and click on record, not first for each function study the manual. so i am much more happy with garageband. if ""live"" is freeware it would be acceptable, but for bucks i am awaiting something better!",0
"i just buy this program,but i can't used because the code keys dosen't work i just try to contact costumer support,but they didn't help me they have a stupid sistem, when you entered the keys code became a pop up who said the key code is not acepted, i'm sick and tired about costumer support, for this reason i can't used this program,,,,it realy sucks!!!! don't buy it......",0
"i am new to amazon.com and all i wanted to do is buy the windows xp super pack, but you just keep showing all these other products and there is nowhere for me to just buy it and go, so i guess you just lost a customer because if you make it this hard for me to check out and be on my way, then i might as well just go to the store and pick it up myself. thanks anyway but i really dont want to sit here and keep trying to buy this item and getting everything else plus the kitchen sink. so maybe later on down the road i'll try you again and see if youve made it any easier to just put an item in your cart , check out and be done, without all the song and dance about everything else you keep trying to sell me. sincerely, queencolleen.",0

"this c i do not recommend, i recommend microsoft visual c ++, the book windows game programming for dummies. these are good things, to get. i look up on web sites and found a site and he is a video game designer and programmer. he recommended these. so, get the advanced one and not this one. borland is not a good company to by from. microsoft is the leading company so this is good but spend a little bit more money, about dollers is. so in conclusion, i recommend some other software to use if you want a good solid software, altough this is a software.",0
"this software is very hard to use. the help video goes too fast, the manual doesn't cover everything and nothing is intuitive. i have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money.",0

"my dad got this for me to supplement a latin textbook i have been studying for my high school language course. it is quick and easily understandable. you get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. if you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. it doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. the latin cd also does not use the dashes over the vowels (ie. ,,,,). overall, i am very happy with the product and with the price of $ . (usd), but i am also quite glad i have my textbook (ecce romani) to go with it.",0
"i love mac, ok, but not being able to email a file is a huge overlook!!i just typed up a pages document and i can't gmail it or send it via webmail. i'm upset.so what if it's compatible with other programs unless it can be sent to people with those other programs! thats the main reason that compatability is important in my opinion.don't get me wrong, it is a great program. pretty intuitive actually. but as far as business is concerned...........big pain in the buti just bought the iwork and i needed to type up a proposal asap.",0
as stated when i bought the card it was for use for my holiday in florida but it arrived after i left for my holiday.i have since lent the garmin sat-nav and card to work friend and he used it in florida and said it worked ok my family and friends are going to florida for christmas&new year and i will try the card for myself.,0
"i've been a long time buyer of magix products, i think they're an incredible company but do not buy this collection thinking it will work in a cd-rom drive (like most dvd movies do). i purchased it from magix (for twice this price) and nowhere did it say i needed a dvd-rom to use it. j&amp;r music world (another great store) advertises this here as a cd-rom media format, it's not. it was very disappointing seeing that i was really interested in trying this newest collection of soundpools. i never got the chance to try it so i give it stars, i'm sure the content is excellent. buy only if you have a dvd-rom drive!",0
"i use turbo tax software every yr..since and this is the first time i have had an error in the software. who do i contact about this mistake. can you give me a number to call intuit and tell them about the mistake and see if anyone else has had this problem ...it is on the dependant page, there is no back or continue button. you are just stuck when you get to this page.thank youjoyce o vespie",0
"i don't have the product (had to add a star value to enter this comment so i went in the middle) but these reviews were not what i wanted to hear. i recently switched over to mac because i gave up on trying to keep my pc running, error, virus and spyware free - which seemed to be impossible. the mac has been great for over a year now but the one thing i miss from the pc was dragon dictation - i was happy with that program. very accurate, wrote way faster than i could ever type and spelling was % accurate except for some words that sound the same but have different meanings.i was hoping to get a similar program for the mac but after reading reviews for this and viavoice, i don't know.",0
i have used mcafee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product. i bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall (zonealarm) in my case. that is the only negative i have found so far. the mcafee firewall seems sufficient so far.,0

"straight and simple. it doesnt copy every dvd. it does copy a lot of them. some dvd movies are css protected, some are not. companies like pixar and disney spend a little extra money on css encryption coding- to keep all dvd profits in-house. i dont blame them. after all its a business. the mouse is a billionare ya know? so all you trendy people who buy their computers from walmart because they have dvd burners... stay out of blogs about technology you dont understand nor want to take time to learn about. some of you are trying to experience big budget movies on "" tvs anyway.it only gets stars from me beacuse they havent figured out the css encryption problem yet.i have over movies at home....some are copies some are the originals. its about codes and profits, knowledge and ignorance. which side are you on?",0

no problem getting this up and running as a &quot;workstation&quot;. no more of a chore than any flavor of windows i've ever tried. but my reason for buying red hat linux is to use it as a server os. over two weeks into attempting to integrate my linux server into a windows client environment and still not being successful at it makes me think there has to be a better way.,0
"i've owned xp for a couple of years, and its a great system. it doesnt crash, its easy to use, and its customization is much better then vista and mac osx (but not better then linux.) its the most professional, its used by business people. its also great to have if your a bit geekier. you can change the themes. code and game if you want. its just more flexible (mac osx/vista isn't.)right now i'm running vista (i hate it, and so do all my freinds) and on another computer (a shiny new imac) i have apple. it comes down to this:xp > mac osx > vista. and linux goes somewhere in there depending on who you are.overall xp is the best. there are a few exceptions, like being dumb/effortless, or being a professional photographer/video maker, but xp is better for normal stuff. and no one, and i mean no one, should use vista.",0
"have photoshop elements and like it very much. however, almost every time you start it it says update required and it then downloads adobe photoshop album- no matter what. no matter how often you uninstall it, it comes right back with the next suggested update.i might live with it except, i believe, that once album works with your pictures you can't access them any more without album. it's like outlook express. i may be wrong on this, but be aware of the possibility. you also get it when you update reader.i rate pse because i can't stop the downloads of ps album starter edition.i don't know if this happens with .",0
"i've got to say; you have to have an interest in ancient culture to play this game. it gets pretty boring otherwise. also, i am stuck at the part of the cave where you have to answer what pacal was afraid of. i tried talking to the hospital-bound what's-his-name, but he didn't know and now the hospital is closed, apparently never to open again. this must be a glitch of some sort and it really annoyed me! this game is nearly impossible so you have to use a hint website--overall, i think, the worst of the nancy drew games i've played so far.",0

"received the product on a saturday. still in box, but computer prompted me to enter product id number on sunday. microsoft word is overwhelming at this point; prefer works. am sure this is powerful, effective software, but seeking help is frustrating. video glimpses of product features offer little insight. at this early point in my microsoft usage, i think the product is a bit expensive and doesn't exactly fit my need for a usable word processing program.",0

"one of the things that is absolutely killing the mac platform (less than % marketshare, as of mid ) is the astronomically higher prices you must pay for software. apparently windows users can get a basic version of quicken in the $ range (let's face it, who uses the deluxe features anyway?) but mac users are paying upwards of $ . i have an old verson of quicken that came with my original imac. i have no intention of upgrading. apple is not going to be around for the long term anyway. the software vendors like intuit are making sure of that.",0

"during the brief browsing of this review list, i noticed plenty of complaints which may or may not be directly related to this product. the product can only perform as well as the system on which it is installed. for a real review of any software, dont trust someone who knows next to nothing about computers and how they work. instead go to any number of online places for fair and honest information (there are plenty of people whose profession is evaluating and reviewing software...)rather than trusting the ramblings of some secretary who only knows how to use or products and log in to her aol account. you could be unhappy for the wrong reason just becuase you listen to someone who doesnt know the first thing about what they are telling you...!",0
it's a very good movie. my favorite part was when eliza was rescuing the elephants. she used her heart to rescue them. i would watch the movie again.,0
"o.k.--let me first say this--i'm no prude by any means-- but was all the sex really that necessary? it was to the point of being gratuitous. i mean, we are all sexual beings, but this film went a tad overboard with the heterosexual as well as the homosexual sexual escapades.other than that, i really liked this movie. the acting was superb by everyone. jullianne moore has always been a favorite of mine--why she hasn't snagged as oscar yet is beyond me. her performance is matched by annette bening. i'm convinced, come awards season, nominations will be kind to them both. and what can you say about mark ruffalo???--he is just beyond sexy in this film.i just wish the film had a little less sex and a little more moore/bening dramatic interaction.",0

"it is beyond me why this is the most popular distribution. it feels clunky and unfinished, it certainly offers nothing more (and for multimedia support considerably less) than other packages out there. documentation is pitiful. it's not the cheapest either. i personally think that running linux on the desktop is as practical as driving around town on a mack truck, but if you insist on giving it a whirl you'll be better served by the like of mandrake or suse.",0

my year old daughter bought this and she loved it so much that her twin wanted one of her own. its interactive babies leave off where you do like a game so her sister wanted her own game. santa brought her one and now we were told she can't use it on our computer because it recognizes it as the same game. now only one of our children can use it unless she doesn't care that someone else will change the way she has it set up with her own baby and her adopted baby. cute program but not with alot of interested children in one house! we'll be returning the other one!,0

"once again, microsoft has put out a product that is not ready yet. i resent paying $ to be a beta tester for microsoft. the install was going along smoothly until a report came out that said almost all of my devices might not work. i guess i should be thankful that i was informed about this before the new o/s was completly installed. i am not returning it, i am just going to wait until it is fully supported.the thing that bothers me most is that the devices that i use are not uncommon or obscure. they are mainstream things like a printer, scanner, router, cable modem, etc..i purchased win me several moths ago and installed that instead. that seems to be the theme with ms, buy it when it comes out and wait until you can use it.",0

"this was purchased for a child, at the request of that child. personally, i don't care for the game. it was clearly scraped together at the last minute to exploit the film - it's a generic pirate game with no distinguishing characteristics except johhny depp on the jewelcase cover. i rather resent that.in addition, it performs poorly with windows xp, and there is no patch that i can locate. the -year old recipient of the game manages to make it work, but even he thinks it's a rip-off: fun enough, but nothing special. he's playing it while he waits impatiently for ""potc ii"".",0
"i am somewhat ambivalent towards flash cards, but my son will sit down and read through the entire pack. and it gives him a fun game to play with his mother. so it is kind of like a ripley's book only broken down into cards. i think anything that encourages small kids to read has to be a good thing. so, i bought him another pack of cards yesterday. again, he sat down and read through it and was ready to play it with his mother when she came home.",0

"if you want a features list, go to the site - everything it says it can do it does, but the cost is an odd complement for the features. is it worth the ease and intigration for the extra dollars over visual c++ . ? i'm not that sure, but i think you might rather take the extra hour or so to create a window with api or mfc than earn the extra money - then again, it might be because i haven't graduated highschool yet. hopefully that will not bring up any prejudices, as i did make sure i attempted at all the options, and i must say i am happy with the product, but would i recommend paying the toll? no - although the server tools and language integration (i can now work with a friend who uses java), the cost is very steep.",0

"here are my thoughts on nav . for antivurus protection, it is one of or even ""the"" best. if you have an old/slow computer, this may not be the program for you. otherwise, it is a great program. for spyware removal, norton ranks low on the test scores. i run webroot spysweeper for spyware detection and removal. unfortunately, there are a lot of bad folks out there that get their kicks out of messing with our computers. a free or no-name antivirus program just won't give you the protection that nav will. until nav gets better with spyware detection and removal, you will need a second program. if you really do your research, i think you will find that to be the case with all the antivirus programs. my two cents worth is buy nav - and buy spysweeper or spy doctor(i think that is the other program with good test scores). good luck!",0

"there is not much out there in ukrainian language learning software, so this is a good start. it covers basic some basic vocabulary, but only a few travel phrases. it was simple and easy to use. not much depth, but is billed 'beginning level.' i did not care for the 'ditzy' personalities or the gambling motif, but that is all window dressing. almost the same as instant immersion - talk now: russian! --except for the language of course.",1
"well, maybe i was expecting too much but for the $ + price i was expecting much greater coverage of the entire country. not being a prior fodor's guide user i was expecting this guide to be much more like the michelin guides i used when in europe. wrong! the level of detail and coverage outside of just a few of the major metro areas is minimal to nonexistant. this product should be called ""an overview of selected sites in north america"" not worth the money!",1
"i was disappointed in this package. there was no rhyme or reason, no direction, no coaching on where to begin. i was hoping to use it for my teenager and she was completely lost. if you want to learn the mechanics of the language, don't buy this package. if you simply want to memorize a bunch of phrases and words in french, i guess its ok. definitely not what i expected for software in todays interactive environment",1
"our son is and he loves this program. it is an inexpensive way to get your child to learn some basic spanish. there is no english translation, however, so it helps if you know a little spanish.",1
"this program does not support anything but x resolution for ntsc or the corresponding pal resolution. for dv project sources, this is a non-issue. if you've captured footage from your analog camcorder at x and give it to pe as imported media, it assumes that you want your final project to have a distorted picture with wide black margins on the sides, i.e. it assumes your source has 'missing' pixels. if your using pe for the straight and narrow, (dv in/out or dvd out) it's probably fine. if you're looking for a general purpose movie editor that accepts a wide variety of input formats and has the flexibility to create a wide variety of output formats, don't buy pe.",1
great item! i don't know how i would have gotten though northern italy without it! i stayed at some smaller hotels on little streets and it was no problem. the only reason i did not give it a five star is because it included no written instructions.,1
the software is effective and even somewhat entertaining although very basic. i would definitely recommend this package to someone who is just beginning to learn greek as it walks you through the basics very well.,1
"this would be a fantastic upgrade if it weren't for the activation requirement. i work from several locations on three computers (including my mom's -- she has no clue how to use it), and i'd like to install the product on all three computers, including a laptop. activation, of course, prevents this.keep version if you have it. the enhancements for the most part (except for text) won't be missed.i will say that adobe's activation policy is many times better than quark's, and they do have a good customer service team that might cut you some slack. this version is the best ever, but my advice is to just say no to activation.",1
"i've been using calendar creator to make our annual family calendars for over years now (starting with cc ). the latest version is even easier to use with its wizards, more templates and stored pictures. more pictures are available online but usually at additional cost. i just use my own photos which is what personal calendars are all about anyway.many of the extra features in the program such as daily events and business type annotations, i never use. the deluxe version of calendar creator has even more extras that to me doesn't warrant the additional expense.overall this is a great way to make personalized calendars.",1
"my faith in microsoft is restored by windows . it's a much more reliable operating system than winme, and has never crashed on me in the couple of weeks that i've been using it (by contrast, winme crashed on a daily basis).the user interface is pretty easy...can't say whether it's different from windows nt, as i haven't used that os.windows me is touted as being a better os for multimedia, and perhaps that's true. however, i haven't encountered serious problems in that department. the most significant problem is that baldur's gate ii seems to run much slower under windows than it did under windows me.but the stability and information security is well worth that tradeoff.",1
"i had previously bought mcafee office . for my laptop and had nothing but problems. i had a difficult time removing mcafee office . from my machine and still had traces of the program showing up. anyway, enough about mcafee office which must be the worst program built ever. nortons system works is easy to use, fixed the problems mcafee left behind, and is worth every penny. the one button checkup makes life much easier. the integration and slick look and feel makes using this program enjoyable. i have never been happier.",1
"the gps works great. the software is difficult to use, voice commands do not always work and if you make a wrong turn it does not recalculate. i would not recommend buying this product. software has too many bugs.",1
i can't say enough about this program. it's really easy to use.you can download your account from your banks internet site. that way you are always up to date on your account. pay bills online. print out monthly reports. track your monthly spending.great program.,1
"this product works well for me. first i had to obtain a good copy. i purcahsed one from a vendor for $ , thinking i made a good deal. after receiving it, it would not work! the vendor also refused to take it back! i then purchased one for $ & it worked well. i would simply tell others, if the price sounds too good to be true, chances are there is a problem! i use excel and word on a daily basis with my job. i know some people want the latest releases, but i simply can not see why i would spend $ for office when i get get this for $ & it works the same! so i would recommend to anyone, buy one of these and save a fortune. do not buy a cheap $ one becasue of my experience, but the mid-priced versions work & i could not be happier.",1
"at first glance, a thought comes to your head - &quot;wouldn't it be cool to create your very own video game!&quot; i work for the video game publisher vatical entertainment and believe me, this is anything but easy. the one program, genesis d, can be downloaded for free at genesis d.com, and the book tells you nothing accept a few interviews with publishers. the documentation is just short c++ references to the source code in the engine which you wouldn't be able to understand without an extensive knowledge of c++ much less know how to use it to make a game. it doesn't come with a -d modeler, which you need, just an animator which i believe you can also get for free. so in short, even though it looks and sounds great, you would never be able to create a game using it.",1
be very careful that your system meets the requirements before you purchase this software. if your computer doesn't support sse (do you even know what that is? i didn't) it just won't install. unfortunately all three of my pcs have amd xp chipsets so this software won't work.the packaging isn't helpful unless you know for sure if your computer supports sse .it seems like a problem that adobe woudl put out a piece of commercial software that won't install on some very popular computers.,1
"i have to agree with all these reviews already posted. i was getting error messages for intuit stating that i would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so i ordered a new copy of quicken for $ thinking it would be an upgrade. to my amazement, it is exactly the same as quicken , no real developments. i feel very cheated by intuit. if was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. if they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, i would at least expect and improved product. they are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. i have been buying turbotax every year, and have been a loyal quicken user for many years, but now i think i will look for something else.",1
"this program might work for a child who is getting ready for kindergarten, but it is not up to par for a child who is entering first grade. i bought it for my year old to use as a review between kindergarten and first grade. she completed the entire program in one sitting; i'd guess it took her less than / hour. it is not kindergarten level by any means. my young year old was able to complete it without much effort, so even with a child a year away from starting kindergarten it was a waste of money.",1
i had used turbo tax for several years but surely there is a better program available. the program with the state download &quot;free&quot; had glitches in it and would not setup. contacting customer service was a difficult ordeal to acquire a replacement per instructions within the software. after waiting a very long time on the phone to talk to someone they argued that i buy it even though it came with my program as a &quot;free download&quot; and then even the replacement download was difficult to setup and expired after hrs. customer service does not want to hear they have defects in their software even after a very long wait on the phone to talk to them. i cannot recommend turbo tax software and will try something different next year.,1
"i've used printmaster platinum on dvd and liked it well enough but the disk wore out. i knew from reviews of subsequent versions that broderbund was giving us less and less but even still i was stunned by just how much less. where are all the projects? even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone. for kid's masks, version has at least a dozen but this version gives you ! the cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background. (at least you won't need much ink). in short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself. inspired by the one nice-looking cut-out card, i was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that i would be pleased to send.",1
"the metroguide software for france is more useful than the us version. the maps seem more up to date, and, due to the difficulty of finding anything in france, much more useful. i managed to find our company's new building in a new town by punching in the address, and i was able to use my emap to find it in minutes from the train station. it also seems to have up to date restaurant and attraction info for paris and other areas.",1
"i would have given this -stars had adobe been a good company for customer support, but they aren't. pagemaker is easy to use,full of goodies and if used to create what it was designed for it is the best. neither indesign nor quark match pagemaker for ease of use in designing books, brochures, magazines, etc. pagemaker was a huge improvement over . in that images are now sharp and not out of focus as they were with the first in the series.i don't think pagemaker is worth the $ listed by amazon and other online sellers. i'm amazed it's still available but should think if you are doing books and want a software that makes excellent and accurate indexes and table of contents and also is easy to edit with its story editor, then this one is for you.",1
"i recommend this product because of it's improvement in two general areas of disk defragmentation: ) it does most of its work in the background stealing idle cycles to defrag key files and keeping your disk somewhat tuned. ) it also has a more sophisticated tunning process. it can tune the master table in addition to just files, it also seems capable of defragmenting disks that the standard defragmenter cannot do (i never understood this limitation).i have noticed a significant performance improvement since i installed diskeepeer.",1
"i bought this product based on the reviews from this site. while i see how this software certainly could be great (very powerful and easy to use) it failed me in two key areas: .) for whatever reason, the avi files from my cannon powershot s digital camera are not compatible with the video deluxe software. the magix support staff, of course, blamed cannon and provided no help whatsoever, even though the cannon avi files work fine with competitor software produced by roxio and arcsoft. considering the popularity of cannon cameras, this incompatibility is a major liablity. .) again, for whatever reason, the video deluxe software crashes my computer every time i attempt to burn a vcd or dvd. again, the roxio and arcsoft software work fine, so the problem is only with video deluxe .despite downloading the most recent patch, it is a shame this software is so riddled with bugs. it certainly has tremendous potential if not for the bugs.",1
"my year old daughter loves playing with this typing instuctor game. it tracks her progress so we can see her accuracy and her speed in the days or weeks to come. it shows the child in an easy an accurate way finger placement. i think there is up to games to play, but we haven't gotten that far yet.i am only giving it stars instead of because we haven't gotten through the whole thing yet. love it so far!",1
this is a great improvement over previous editions; much easier to use and amend. the only reason for a instead of a is that they don't appear to honor special advertised offers of free year memberships in other genealogy data bases when program not purchased directly from encore. very frustrating when expecting access and being told to join each one.,1
"although humongous does a great job, there should be some changes. after a couple months my year old is starting to get bored with this one. the same items are always needed and they're always in the same place. unlike travels through time, which my daughter still plays after a year, the items are in different places and you have to listen closely to the clues each time. i hope that newer products will be better, not just different.",1
"this package is an excellent resource to help individuals who are stumped by the job search process and placing individual skills and qualifications on paper. the program does it all for you. of course, if you're one of those selective individual who is looking for personal style, this is not your program. i work with many job seekers who want a quick resume for the regular workforce. people seem to enjoy and relish the product when all you have to do is press enter and the entire personal data is placed into a chronological and targeted format. i would highly recommend this program for anyone wanting a quick fix to marketing their skills. no one should pay hard earned dollars to have someone else prepare a resume. if you can type, this is it!",1
"i had one heckuva time working around a norton antivirus incompatibility with office xp. i got this nasty message when i launched word or excel: ""norton antivirus does not support the repair feature. please uninstall and reinstall."" i finally found some web postings to turn off the plug-in for office xp to get rid of this error.i then got this weird error message telling me to reinstall norton antivirus every time i boot up my xp home system. it turns out that if you change the default location for the norton antivirus shortcuts in the windows start menu, you can get some big time problems. this took a while for me to figure out and fix.in the past, i've had generally good experience with norton antivirus products. but next time, i'm going to go back to mcafee.",1
"calendar creator has the potential to be the best calendar/scheduling program on the market - but version is probably the best so far. unfortunately, instead of fixing previous problems and enhancing the product, the creators put out upgrades which just add more graphics and ""fluff"" without concentrating on making the basic program better. and, in some cases, they even remove previous functions that were terrific!they have lost many buyers like me who used to upgrade almost every year. this program really needs to have creators who are serious about realizing the full potential of this program - which would increase their sales (and upgrade buyers) by -fold.",1
"anyone who's read my reviews of the delorme street atlas books will know i'm a great admirer of good mapping and of delorme as a mapping company. i've used the early versions of street atlas usa for more than a decade, going back to the . version and bragged about them to friends. i'm sorry to see this great company falling short with their software, gradually declining in their usefulness and usability. the amount of detail for the remote areas on the more recent software releases is receding, the software is becoming too complex to use, and i'm to the point of only recommending delorme in paper. and awfully sorry to have to say it. i'd offer the opinion that delorme needs to back up a few paces and rediscover the needs of their loyal buyers.",1
"kept my rambunctious year old boy entertained for hours, which is difficult to do! many areas to click on and explore.",1
"i purchase this for my neice and she said it was just ok. this product makes alot of noise so you might want to mute it. also, the links are design as if it is a space control panel. i would say this is a tool for childre who are beginners and non-english speakers.",1
"i have been using print shop with windows xp, so i was pleasantly surprised to see how nice this version for the mac is. it is much better & easier to use than the one i had for the pc (it was also version , but maybe it was old). lots of nice tool windows & some additional features.",1
"this product suite has a number of software tools, some very good and at least one that is really bad. the registry editor is supposed to be excellent. however, i purchased this suite to try to 'clean' a virus infested pc. the virus checker/remover is by a company called trend micro, and the version they include in this package is essentially useless. on running it, it provide a list of viruses but was unable to eliminate any of them. i don't know why, as i was able to manually delete all but one in which access was denied by windows. however, manual deletion of virus files must be accompanied by registry changes and i found little help for this at the trend micro site; most of the information seemed to be outdated or wrong for the viruses in question and some seemed to be misidentified. i later obtained a free product, free-av, that succeeded where this product failed utterly.",1
studio is an easy to use integrated solution for anyone who wants to photo edit easily and cheaply.its adobe competitors bloatoshop and elements both require mb ram and xp to run. studio only needs mb ram and runs on win also so is the only option if you have a pc with these specifications. of course it also runs on xp with mb as well.the interface for studio is much more intuitive than the adobe products and is much easier to use and learn. there are also many books and websites available to take you as far you want to go with studio.the only minor criticism is that studio is bundled with photo album standard rather than advanced. it would be nice to get the advanced version in the bundle.bottom line: if you are a photo enthusiast who appreciates an easy to use and good value photo editor then studio is for you.on the other hand if you like doing things the hard way and enjoy paying through the nose then adobe will gladly separate you from your money.,1
"i have used this software now for a week and am still struggling with it. i think the product is powerful, maybe too many features for my needs, but figuring out how to use it is really tough. the users manual was clearly written by someone for whom english is a second (maybe third) language. if you are willing to make the effort to fight through this, you can do a lot. i have now used the note processor like a word processor to document music i have written and i have entered music from the virtual keyboard. it is so much nicer than my handwriting.",1
"i have been using the ""free"" version of this software for years. it has become a critical component for all of the systems i work on. the pro version offers a little more functionality and features than the ""free"" version. it works beautifully in protecting your system. i would not recommend using a computer on the internet without it.the updated features for the pro version are: spyware protection and e-mail protection. it also monitors your installed virus protection to make sure its up to date. another nice feature is that it has identity data protection, which will protect your sensative information like credit card numbers.if you are unsure whether or not you need this program, check out their website and try the ""free"" version. the free version does not have any special ""extras"", but will help to demonstrate why its such a valuable program to have on your system. purchasing the pro version will unlock all of the features mentioned above. keep your system safe!",1
"i do not highly recommend this software. it was easy to install, but that's about the only good thing about it. ever since i have installed this software, i get error messages every single time i go into it to use it. if you download pictures and want to crop, etc. in picture it!, the program can barely hold all the photos at once without running out of memory. and forget about attempting to crop all photos in succession. the program will always shut down on you and you will end up re-booting your computer a million times before you are done. also, most of the graphics for this software are not downloaded with the initial program, so everytime you want to do a project with one of the picture it! images, you have to insert one of the cd roms just to get the picture. a hassle all around. i'm shopping around for better picture software right now........",1
the best you can expect from broderbund or is it encore? anyway don't buy this product because of the logo creator like i did. save your $$ and buy the less expensive version of print shop which is just as good for most desktop publishing needs. the logo creator needs a lot of upgrading. not that user-friendly and the import feature is a pain to use and does not work most of the time.,1
i had no problem figuring out the software interface. the commentaries and parallel translations are great. i have used the study guide to develop sermon outlines. it would take a stack of books feet tall to equal the resources available. the niv is not public domain like so many older translations so you don't find as many programs available. kudos to zondervan for developing such a good niv resource.,1
"these encore educational sets, though labeled with the latest year in the edition they're trying to sell at any given moment, are really changed very little from one edition to the next - which explains the phenomena of the ""extra"" drivers needed for xp which an earlier reviewer noted.the good news is that these sets are commonly available, used, for five bucks or less in the thrift stores... and they are worth that amount, certainly. so i'd suggest trying an old copy first, then deciding if the latest and greatest revision is worth the upgrade to you.",1
"although its not my favorite it was still very exciting! i love these games so much, and so do my older sister ( ) and younger ( ). although im the fanatic =). the only problem i had with this one was it got very irritating going back and forth through the train, most of the other games have more places to go...this one was for the most part the train. but the story plot was so cool and interesting it kept me going so i could find out more! so many turns and twists it will have you guessing until the very end!",1
"simply the best software for creating personal projects. contains hundreds of ready made templates for just about anything you would need or want from cards to banners, signs to crafts, labels to envelopes . it is easy to navigate with the graphic interface. thousands of clipart images and photos are include for just aboput any occaision and all are % scalable",1
"i ues this software soley for recording my guitar licks via line guitar port. i bought a tascam dp- digital recorder for $ and now it is collecting dust. this software was low price (...)when i have a guitar lick or idea, i simply plug in and record. i only have to play the lick once, and i can loop it over and over again. i have recorded demo albums already. for the price, this is a steal!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i bought and installed this product because i had a new computer and i required the tools to access and manage various work documents. i figured it would be a moderately useful upgrade on previous office products. however i was mistaken.this version of microsoft office takes the concept of ""bloatware"" to new heights ... it seems the folk at microsoft have been distracted by their own interface trinkets and have forgotten to address even basic useability issues. the result is a program that is sluggish, counter-intuitive and presents a whole new learning curve, even for those who are/were familiar with previous versions of office.if you have a lot of time on your hands to learn a ""new"" way of doing things that different without being better (frequently worse) - and you have no desire to work efficiently with your computer, then perhaps there would be nothing to complain about with this new version. otherwise, i really can't recommend it.",1
"backs up data from phone to pc just fine (lg vx ). does not *synch* phone to pc, or pc to phone. simply overwrites one with the other.it will only upload the entire contents of the phone contact list (takes about minutes for numbers). it will not upload only changes. same for downloads to the phone; all or nothing. this also means it is nearly useless for editing contacts on the pc. takes too long to upload entire database, change one or more items, then download entire database again.there is a ""merge"" feature, but only for two or more databases of numbers in datapilot's pc database.datapilot will import numbers from outlook, but marks each one with a comment ""outlook contact."" the comment then gets downloaded with the number to the phone so that every number has the same comment. stupid waste of phone memory.",1
"having tested other html editors (macromedia, adobe, netobjects and microsoft), i think that frontpage is not the best anymore. this has some few new features and a facelift but that's all. if you are really serious creating web sites the best choice is macromedia dreamweaver . , there is no product like that and if you want to create dynamic database driven web sites, macromedia ultradev . is simply the best.ms frontpage is good if you want to create some informational web sites and that's it, but if you want to create something more powerful with interactivity then get the macromedia product, you will not regret.",1
"i loved the other pajama sam games, so when i purchased this one, i was disappointed.there is only one path. the storyline doesn't involve sam learning anything like the previous games.what were they thinking?it seems that, after successfully expanding the backyard sports line, they decided to take a chance with the junior adventures. the thing is, so many original people from humongous left by the time the company was sold to atari, that they had no guidance whatsoever, except for a few copies of the other pajama sams. being 'busy executives', however, they had no time to thoroughly play through the game, and immediately assumed it had only one path.the result was a game that is completely devoid of all the charm of the other junior adventures. the graphics were good, but the one path and other things put me off. however, i must commend them for at least attempting to mimic the greatness of humongous entertainment.nice try, atari. better stick to the backyard sports from now on.",1
i just returned from a mile trip using the s/t . i too had a little trouble with the activation as i was not near wifi most of the time but once i got a good connections it worked.in general it worked well. i did laugh when a huge lake in bc did not show up on one side of the road i was traveling beside. it is hard to read a lot of the small type in the car. looking for the different colors of the minuscule blocks to see which was a restaurant and which was a bank was a problem. gps reception can be spotty even when it appears it should be ok. on one or two occasions it did confuse left and right but the map was there to confirm.all in all though it bailed me several times when i had know idea where i was in rural bc. it also got me through vancouver and seattle with no hassles. i also love being able to save my trip plans and reuse them again.,1
"i had version . of this software and tried upgrading to . , hoping it would cure some of the problems. the program has great features (for the price)... like being able to pick from a large catalog of plants, see d and d versions of your layout, and watch your landscape project grow and change with time and seasons. but the software is buggy. every time i tried placing a driveway on my lot, the program crashed. worse yet, the original creator (sierra software) no longer develops the software. the new vendor was very helpful and willing to support, but they provide no fixes. i ended up asking for a refund. unfortunate.",1
the program is more than sufficient to prep anyone for the exams covered. the classes are well presented...certainly a lot cheaper than going to a $ prep course..this covers the same material!!,1
though is has a good library. it does not have a straight forward approach. nor are you able to take the lessons with you or away from the computer.,1
"i purchsed this software to transcribe tapes, and it has really given me some much needed relief from heavy typing. i'm able to wear both the headphones for the transcriber and for via voice, and i just dictate what i'm hearing from the transcribed tape! the easiest way to dictate, i found, is directly through the pad, and just cut and paste into word. also, regardless of how poor you think your oratory skills are, speaking in your natural tone of voice helps the software to &quot;learn&quot; your voice pattern much quicker. i have found that even when i stumble over words that i use all the time, if i just do the voice analyzer after every session, it becomes more and more accurate. for a girl with a southern twang and drawl, that saying a lot!",1
the software was installed on three computers and slowed two down so much i had to remove it on and have not put it back on it worked fine on one of the three,1
"i bought this software hoping to work on our weekly spelling lists. first, in order to input your list of words you have to also input ""incorrect"" spellings for each of the words, a major pain.second, of the games, none of them include ever spelling your words! all i want is for my kids to practice spelling their words, obviously too much to ask for a spelling program by jumpstart. i can't believe how disappointing this program is.",1
"i bought this so i'd be able to open excel documents that i receive in email, as well as for word. while i'm reasonably pleased with the word functionality, potential buyers should know that the spreadsheet program is not excel or even excel lite, and is not fully compatible with .xls documents. i find this very irritating.",1
"this game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. the only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. you either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like i did. my sister finished the ""castle"" in about hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. it is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.",1
"i found that i can not learn another language without any english involved. i don't like having to guess at what they would like for me to know just by looking at pictures. i need to hear it in english first and then hear the foriegn phrase.i also think that if you use this software, you will definitely need a dictionary in order to research what they are saying.",1
"i have read some really bad press about powerdirector , lockups etc. i tried several others, ulead video studio , showbiz . and sony vegas .each has its issues, strengths and weaknesses. i finally downloaded powerdirector premium.. i got to say, that it works really well. i like it the best. a few items could be more intuitive, but all in all, im impressed. plus, the price is right at $ . . plenty of control for me! exports to many common formats including divx.update..after using the product for a couple of days, im less impressed. its locked up a few times, and sometimes operates very slowly. its kind of a pig. nice features, but doesnt appear to be real stable. i think at this point im voting for 'showbiz .

"i bought carrara after using the likes of lightwave and d studio max r . . carrara is a very good program but extremely buggy. don't expect too much from its ik system as it cannot be used on a solid mesh nor does it support an object skeleton of any kind, the photoshop plugins don't work even though the package states that it does. the z axis is mapped to the y axis which is extremely strange. there are no plugins to support other metacreations major titles ie: poser and bryce. hopefully these setbacks will be fixed later. adobe has purchased carrara from metacreations so i expect to see good things come out of it, however the manual, like most metacreations product manuals, leave much to be desired. this is a good product, but buggy and sometimes, down-right strange! if you want to be a professional and have the money, i would look elsewhere to lightwave, truespace, d studio max or maya. those are proven and powerful programs and support industry standards.",1

"i recently upgraded from money . i was pleasantly suprised with the ability of downloading transactions for all credit card , bank and investment accounts. so all you have to do is check the info downloaded daily weekly whenever you want. had a little trouble with one investment account but overall was easy to setup. this is real nice for those of us who are not very fast on the keyboard.was hoping to get a product to help with retirement planning but after reviewing found it to be real weak in this area.",1
"i use this software in my school for a video production class. it is amazingly easy to use, yet creates amazingly complex and well made films. i wouldn't recommend trying to use it on an i-mac though. i would suggest using a g to properly use this software. there are a few minor faults in the editing area. for one thing it is almost impossible to input extra footage into an almost finished video. nevertheless, it is a great program. the effects are amazing. if you don't have a digital camera to use with your computer you will need to get a vcr and a converter. if you have the cash to buy this software and have some fun with it i would definitely suggest getting it.",1

"my -year old really enjoyed the game the first few times. however, since the location of the clues never changes, it lost some of the excitement after that. he still likes the accomplishment of completing the game, and the chance to solve the mystery at the end. the graphics are good. this one is a little easier than the phantom of the knight - this gives more verbal instructions how to find the clues. overall, for young scooby fans, i highly recommend this and phantom.",1
"while the navigation function may be somewhat lacking when compared to mapopolis or tomtom -- the poi database is far superior to what you can get from the hard core navigation programs. a real plus for me is with you can now load the maps onto a smartphone, in addition to ppc's and pc's. i now leave my ppc (an old dell x ) home more often and just take the smartphone (audiovox ).i've used previous version s&t; on the ppc for several years and find it quite useful. i also have/use iguidance (gps nav) software. i really think the two packages together make the ultimate male toy -- never ask for directions again!!!.",1
"i'm not sure why there are those who say the program is bloated. the program is large, no question, but it covers a lot of ground. the disc authoring alone is huge as there are a lot of disc types it covers. apparently burning data and music are vastly different, which i found when i used this program. it takes a lot more time burning music which is due to coversion and having dolby stereo audio. it's not just the size of the files that affects the burning time.the photo editing program is very comprehensive and this is like a packaged program by itself. add to that the slide shows and other projects and the suite offers a lot of photo project features. it may be huge, but i think all the programs are of use.",1

"this program doesn't seem to be good for absolute beginners, but it's good for expanding your vocabulary. it took me a while working with other programs for learning chinese before i was ready to make good use of this one. dictionary part of it is awesome because you can see how the words are written in chinese characters as well as in pinyin. it has lots of fun games to test your comprehension and a lot of the material is focused on testing your knowledge of chinese characters.the program does teach some dialogues as well as grammar and it is helpful for making sure you're pronouncing the words correctly, but for me the greatest benefit of this program lies in helping one to learn lots of words and characters. you get to learn about words and characters and the best part about all of these words is that you get to hear them and you get to play with characters through lots of fun games. it really does help to retain the information.",1
"i bought this game from a software club on a whim. my and year old boys were sort of interested in chess, and my husband's name is fritz. so i thought if i was lucky, the software could help them learn some of the basics of chess. it has far surpassed my expectations. they love it, and have spent hours playing it. they know how all the pieces move, have learned some of the finer points such as ""castling"", and still keep playing. i hear them repeating the little rhymes that the program uses to help them remember different strategies....""a knight on the rim is ugly and dim""....""pawns are afraid of nothing; they move straight ahead"", etc. in just a couple of weeks, they know way more than i know about chess. i would love to have this program in my middle school classroom, as i think my students there would enjoy it, as well.",1
"i will most likely never use the translator in word or excell, but the job it does on web pages is well worth the price. it takes a web page, with all of the pictures and the links, and translates them to a chosen language without messing up the web page format. you essentially see the exact same page with all the same layout transformed into another language. currently, % of all pages on the web are not in english. without this tool you are missing % of the available data. i saw this program demo at comdex and i bought it on the spot. the translations are not always perfect, but you will get the information you need without much straining. anyone who needs to surf the web for information should have this program!",1
"compared with win it is a very stable os. i haven't had the amount of crashes that i had with win when using tasking programs like macromedia dreamweaver. it is a necessity for businesses but if you want a gaming os, don't use it. i have set up a dual boot system installing win over win . it is very user friendly to set up. overall this is a good os.",1
"after i received the product i installed it, using it was not very difficult and designing was fairly easy. i did not like the flexibility of customizing my design and its contents. d deign looks great on the computer but printing those pictures turn out horrible. the software was not what i read it to be and it did not work well for me and what i wanted it to do. i am a small remodeler and the idea was to design the job leads and print them out for an impressive proposal! not good for that type of detail. i am going to give the bhg pro a try. the great thing about buying this software is the guarantee that you will like it, if not you can call customer service and obtain a return rma and get your money back within days. i did! ease of use for your personal designs, fine, flexibility of custom designs, not good.",1

"yes, i know this isn't the ""upgrade"" version. i found this for a lot less at compusa and i bought the new computer version when i upgraded from a to a gb hard drive, so it was infact just like ""a new computer"" when i installed this.first of all, let me say that i am very glad i bought this. xp has taken care of pretty much all of the computer nightmares that i had with me. the only complaint i have is with battery life. xp uses up more battery life and so my laptop doesn't run on the battery for as long as it's suppossed to. also, the windows firewall that comes with service pack doesn't work that well. it's better than nothing (i think). my dad had horrible problems with his computer before i convinced him to purchase the norton personal firewall .",1

"the new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. it may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. this version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. this is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. if microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. the new version does not run macros as fast however. my recommedation for existing users: keep office for as long as you can and consider going to open office when microsoft no longer supports (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of ).",1

i got this game for my birthday and i love it.the first two levels are sort of easy but after it gets really hard.there are lots of weapons like missles and barrels of gunpowder.the only things that i don't like about it is that there is only tracks and the characters are really corny but that's how it is in all lego games.by the way i am a huge lego fan.,1
i have purchased this and already used it in mexico. it is helpful to get you to any of the major cities but even within guadalajara it was clearly very dated and did not compare favorably with a gps that my friend was using that he purchased in mexico.i bought the garmin gps specifically so i could use this map in mexico. i called garmin and asked when an update would be available and was told they have no plans to update. when traveling to ajijic it did not show any streets or even a road to get to the city. ajijic is on the shore of lake chipala -- the largest lake in mexico.let us hope with that with more requests garmin will finally update this map. it is at least five years out of date.ks,1

"having used an earlier version of dragon naturallyspeaking, this product is a great improvement both in accuracy and functions. you will probably need lots of memory (ie mb or more) but i have got reasonable results with this software even on a celeron. being able to save user files is useful, particularly if you have a usb microphone.",1

"i bought this to use with my garmin emap. for the usa the detail level is the same as came preinstalled on the unit--major highways. i've used it in london, cambridge, paris, tokyo and munich. there isn't really enough detail to find your way around any of these cities but it is useful for e.g. finding your way from suburb to suburb. the river cam wasn't very close to where the map had it so it helps to use one's eyes. the maps are dated. we are developing a site in the high andes near san pedro de atacama for the alma telescope--the map of that region did not show the jama road from calama to salta argentina, a major international route (admittedly less than a decade old--but paved!).",1

"i think that this version of ms money is good in the fact that it has become more task based and it has a lot more fuctionality with the ms office programs. i also have found that it is a bit faster the some of the previous versions. the few things that i do not like about it however, are really just personal preference. i don't like the fact that they have gotten rid of a large portion of the customizations for the home page. i also found when i was pulling my tax information for this year, that the reports were not the same as the previous version and i had to build my own. other then that, i think that it is a good peice of software.",1

"i think exploring the titanic on the computer is a lot of fun. the graphics are excellent, and you do sort of feel like you are really there. some of the rooms are very exquisitely decorated, and it's neat to walk out on the deck.i think the game is okay, as adventure games go. pro: the story is pretty good. it progresses at a pretty good pace. cons: the navigation is a bit difficult in some rooms. also, this is one of those games where you spend a lot of time interacting with characters, and choosing from a list of responses. like many adventure games with video, some of the acting is not stellar.i think this game is worth buying if you like to explore, and are intrigued by the titanic story.",1

"i love the photoshop elements for the features it offers to a casual photo enthusiast like myself. as for photoshop album that it came bundled with, i can't say the same. i have been a long time acdsee user and i found album's file organization structure really awkward to use. acdsee allows you to see photos as well as other files in their folders and directory trees. if you know how to use windows, you know how to use acdsee. photoshop allows you to see only image files and arranges them in a calendar chronicle order. this is a problem when you need to delete or transfer photographs in between different directory locations. in short, album might be a good image viewer, but it fails pretty bad when you need to use it for photographs organization. actually, album is not as good as acdsee as a image viewer either because it takes longer to cache and display images. still loving photoshop elements though, just don't pay extra for the album.",1

photosuite looks like it will be a good program if i can ever learn how to use it. i think it would be easy if there were any instructions provided with the program. there is a booklet provided with the program that shows what you can do with the program but not how to do it. very frustrating! i can see the tools on the screen but can't get them to work. i do not appreciate having to spend my very limited time trying to make the program do things i am sure it can do. i don't mind printing a users manual from a readme file but the readme file appears to be only for trouble shooting. i would not recommend this program simple because of the lack of documentation available.,1
"dreamweaver mx is significantly easier to use than previous versions, and is probably the best general-purpose site manager out there. however, for professional, commercial web application development, microsoft's visual studio (featuring .net) beats dreamweaver hands down. there are considerations however- vs costs - times as much as dreamweaver (depending on the version), and requires much more user knowledge and training.i found the learning curve for dreamweaver mx to be insignicant. the first time i used it, i was comfortable with it in a couple of hours, and proficient by the end of a week. if you are an entry-level to mid-level web site developer with limited programming knowledge, the html editor and site management tools should suit your needs. if you wish to do larger scale web application development, you may also do so using dreamweaver's built in support for different technologies. if you want to go high-end, definitely consider visual studio instead.overall, a solid application, and pretty comprehensive package.",1

i have owned streets and trips and it is one of my favorite programs. i bought this to get updated maps and the gps unit. the program has been improved but they removed the pda support. also you now have to authenticate the software when you install it. if you wanted to install this program on your laptop and desktop then you will have to buy another copy. i have to say this is disappointing because this is the type of program that you will want on both computers. right now this is the best program for maps and gps but i am very disappointed with the validation and lack of pda support.,1

i bought this game for my years old daughter. while the game does have a few good ideas and moments i wouldn't say that it's a good product. at the age of kids needs to be pulled in the educational game instead of being forced by the parents. this game in some situations looks like a definite overkill for years old while in others it's too simple. the one thing is certain - my daughter is not engaged and it takes a lot of efforts to ask her to play on a computer this game which never happened before. so while this game does have a few good ideas and is a decent learning product it's far from being perfect or even good enough.,1

"starry night is technically a good product but is not very user friendly in use. limited view area due to clutter in the page layout limits the useability of the product and the screen area setting of x pixels required is not very compatible with most older windows programs. i have to change my screen settings each time i use starry night to get the best page layout and then change back again when i leave the program. several of the programs provided with telescopes are better at providing a much more realistic view of the night sky for star location. advantages of starry night are very current data on satellites, comets and other fleeting phonemena most of which is only visible to observers in very rural areas away from urban light pollution.",1
"i used the garmin microsd data card in my garmin gpsmap cx on a two week hunting trip in montana in november, . performance was excellent after i called garmin tech support to find out how to view the topo data (that would be drill down in scale until the gps will display topo data).the chips are pricey. i would have used a data cd but garmin is not macintosh friendly, so i needed to buy the chips for my hunt.the chips are not marked as to data content, so i used a small ziploc bag to hold the data chip and a note on the contents. otherwise your option is to install the chip in the gps and then view the title.",1
"like another reviewer, i also liked this product, especially its ease of use, and the speed with which you could change your floorplan. but when i got an xp it crashed all the time. to add to the frustration, there is no support from their website for this product. i couldn't even find the product on the site. so i can only recommend it if you have an, apparently older computer. it worked fine using windows , but got slower and slower as my plans got more complicated. when i went to windows xp which i though would help, it became useless.",1
"i found this product dificult to use properly. i wanted to recreate my own oddly shaped family room with its overly large fireplace. i was finally able to get the dimensions i wanted, but the only choice for fireplace was the standard one. i also don't feel that the furniture choices reflected actual sizes and styles available out there--i think the choices the designer used were quite limited. i have to admit, i used this once and found it easier to just do the thing myself on graph paper.",1
"i have been using peachtree accounting and quickbooks software for the past eight years and i think peachtree is better in terms of presentation especially for the financial reports.in quickbooks, anybody can use it in terms of compilation of books but the reporting is not presentable enough to impress the end user especially the big bosses, while in peachtree accounting it is more complicated to non accountants but the financial reporting is more impressive.",1
"gms softwares ""bible with you"" software is much better than quickverse pda edition. i had problems with the installation of the quickverse software and the tech support at quickverse wasn't very good. the quickverse software is dog slow also. gms's pda software is lightning fast when switching between applications. it's a much better product.",1
i purchased this software for my daughter. this software is a bit outdated and has compatability issues with windows xp. it works but not without some tweaking. i've seen better software produced a few years prior to when this product was released. it does offer some learning for children but very minimal. for how much potential it has it delivers very little.,1
i found that webeasy makes pages via extensions and you do not have access to the html. this makes it difficult to add things that webeasy does not provide. it is encouraged to use their own webhost (at $ a month) i have not tried out any other webhost to see if the extensions are compatible.i did find that what you create does not always come out the way you wanted it. i have found many flaws along the way. also the pages look terrible on webtv or aol. i plan to keep looking for a better web authoring system.,1
received a warning that this might not be copaatable with windows vists. i installed it and found the warning to be true.,1
"i love the game! it's very realistic and fun. but sometimes when i play it, i never get past the original city to get my supplies. do not follow what your trail guide says about getting suplies. you always end up getting too much. when your out on the trail, make sure you have a gun and the stuff you need to work it, fishing gear, and plenty of vegetables. when you run out of meat, you'll need to hunt a lot. be sure to gather a lot too. especially right before winter, you can't gather then.",1
"i ordered this product in hope of a good program that would help me learn japanese. i instead was found with a program that, instead of teaching, sent me more on my own to learn. its a lot like going to a book shop and buying a japanese dictionary.though the program has a lot of information, it doesn't give a good guide to show you where to start. there wasn't even an instruction manual packaged with the software. i would recommend another product because i am very displeased with how this one is performing.",1
"i bought this as practice for my -year-old granddaughters who took typing in school this year. have only had it a few days, but they are glued to it during their free computer time. it enourages touch-typing and accuracy.we've found only one flaw. one of the girls pressed the back-arrow to see what would happen and she lost several chapters of the work she had completed. i'm not sure what caused the glitch -- expect it was operator error, but couldn't identify it.they are having a lot of fun practicing, and they are improving speed and accuracy in a short time. i gave it out of stars because i think a children's program should make it difficult to wipe out completed work. if it weren't for that, i would give it stars.",1
"i have used print shop for many, many years on a pc. i just recently switched to a mac and so had to switch to print shop for mac. it is taking some getting used to but it is still the same user friendly program. i can't imagine an easier way to make posters, address labels, post cards and calendars. it seems like there are less graphics to choose from but that is probably due to the ability to download from the internet. all in all i do like this program.",1
"this program is great...at first, then you get lured into it and the bugs keep getting more and more annoying until you are forced to upgrade. we started using the payroll service a few years ago and now to change would be a big nightmare, so we pay every year for upgrades and tech support for all the little &quot;bugs&quot; they put in the program. it seems that at about a year the &quot;bugs&quot; get really annoying and the program itself keeps prompting you to upgrade, asking if you need improved performance and such, which you do because i think they program it to get more sluggish so you upgrade and you are stuck. if you don't want to pay forever and ever, stay away from quickboooks.",1
"the rebate has expired!, but so far it's still listed as coming with a rebate. as for the maps, it seems to be a pretty good atlas, but not as detailed as it led me to believe--i bought it because i wanted detailed geographic maps of certain areas of the uk. not much help there.",1
"mapping is accurate, as far as i can tell. easily loads to my garmin cx from a pc. the reason i gave it out of stars is because it's not compatable with a mac os. i had to use a pc from work to load it. i hope mapsource works on compatability with mac in the future. otherwise, a great product.",1
"make sure you run the compatibility program first.for god's sake, uninstall any software that is uncompatible, namely any norton product, and roxio (adaptec) product especially cd-creator!!!!!!i went for an entire week every day seeking help from dell, microsoft, and roxio ( and all associated newsgroups) trying to get my cd-r/cd-rw working after i upgraded from me to xppro. the software conflicts that resulted from cd-creator clashing with xp could never be resolved even by microsoft. they finally gave up and said, ""it's a software issue, contact roxio"".roxio says, ""it's a microsoft problem""arg!read the newsgroups. hundreds of people cannot use their cd-r/cd-rw drives becuase of this problem. and neither company will help them!finally, i had to reformat my hard drive and start completely over. now, it works but i have to re-install every application back onto my computer and reload all my backup files. what a pain (...)!",1
"i have been using microsoft money since , upgrading every year, and have been pleased until i upgraded to money . i noticed that the checks that i printed did not completely fill out on the ""dollars"" line. the ******* symbol only went a third of the way, this has not happened on any other version. i called microsoft technical support and after three days of ""working on this issue"" they concluded that it was a problem with my hp officejet xi printer. i found that hard to believe since it worked fine with money .",1
"this program is has been working very well for me. though it is level , it does help if you have previous experience with the korean language or at least some supplemental materials. there are no lessons for leaning the hangul, the korean writing system. it helps greatly if you already know this before hand.learning vocabulary and basic grammatical patterns goes quickly because of the rosetta stone method of learning intuitively. this program is great for learning a language as long as it is supplement with other materials.",1
"i've had version for several years. now, i tried to change a filename and it won't let me unless i buy an upgrade! nor will it ""tag"" files. this is inexcusable. a yearly renewal is required??? this was not the policy when i purchased the software. unless you want to renew your ""subscription"" (this can no longer be considered a purchase), most of your ""plus"" features will expire. i'm ticked off. good product, bad policy.",1
"i have been using this software for almost years. it is an excellent way of organizing all of your finances. however, don't believe all the charts and graphs. in some cases, the graphs don't agree with the data or numbers that it uses. as an example,if you sell one stock or mutual fund to buy another, the income/expenses graph may distort the income bar. you need to be very careful of the categories for all the transactions. quicken will communicate with most of the banks, credit card companies and mutual funds, but not all of them. i don' know if it is a quicken problem or the financial institution's. there were changes to last years version that i don't understand yet and it is causing some minor problems.",1
"i see that there are many versions of this great product for sale through different outlets including amazon and broderband. as i have used different versions over the last years, it has become painfully clear that broderband actively sells old product without warning that there is a new version available. when i purchased my latest version . , the 'freebees' were already out-of-date and not available (i wasted postage). it is not xp compatible. then i went to the company website (broderband) and go to the xp compatible page only to see that the latest version listed there is . when there is a . ver released! the . ver page states that it is win xp compatible! i strongly suggest that if broderband wishes to sell older product, they need to be very clear that this is their intention(third-party vendors included). many wasted $$$. shame on you for misleading information through your sellers...",1
"until ' , if you had a mcafee suite but only wanted to use some of its components, and use other programs for other aspects of protection, that worked fine. for instance, i use zone alarm pro for firewall and spyware doctor for spyware, and mcafee ' just for virus. this combination has worked fine, but mcafee ' won't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed. and that's a no-go for me, since some components of mcafee (esp spyware) weren't rated all that well by reviewers.",1
"i've used the dvd workshop trial edition for about days now and it seems to be a great value...i've produced dvds with it from my home movies. it's highly customizable, allows video backgrounds for menu screens, supports background music, and makes setting chapter points a breeze. i've had a few problems with the trial version and like many other ulead customers i can't say their customer support is very good - i think they are overwhelmed. that's not to say the product is buggy, just that the few problems it has aren't intuitive to resolve. dvd moviefactory, also from ulead, is their entry level version of this product...i do plan to purchase dvd workshop when my trial expires.",1
"since i'm not particularly handy around the house, i had high hopes for this cd-rom to help me as i maintain my older house. unfortunately, this cd-rom just scratches the surface of home repair, leaving out many scenarios i've encountered that i don't consider particularly exotic.my wife, who *is* particularly handy around the house, browsed this cd-rom as well, and told me that some of the instructions given were more complicated than necessary.",1
"one warning for all mac users: on the version i have, you have to switch to colors to play. that makes it very difficult to leave the aquarium running while doing other things. the graphics are okay, not as crisp or as stunning as i had hoped. and there is no screen saver mode, which really would be the ultimate for this game. all in all, you have to plan to play it (reset your screen) and then when you get in it, there's really nothing to do but stare at the screen, maybe feed the fish, and then it's boring. i love aquariums and even i wasn't captivated by this game. if you have an old, unused mac sitting around, you might consider just running this game on it / . that might work...",1

"my six-year-old daughter, who just started first grade, was completely engaged playing this game. it has a nice layout to explore, lots of activities, and it adapts to a range of skill levels. it was challenging enough to be interesting but not too hard to ""win"" and save the day for the city. i would give it five stars if only the arcade games were playable -- they were much too hard for my daughter. but she didn't seem to mind, since she really enjoyed everything else.",1
"if you look on the cover of the box of the topo california you will see a picture of a garmin etrex gps handheld reciever. one would think with a picture of the exact same gps handheld that one owns that it would work. it does not. the latest garmin etrex uses an usb port to upload / download data to the pc which is not compatable with the topo software that uses the com , com etc. ports. i wrote an email to topo asking how to correct this problem and they indicated that i could buy the expansion pack for the state series for about $ and then it would work with my gps reciever. so i went to their website to buy the expansion pack and it was priced at . , and it is not availabe at this time. so it looks like i will be using garmin's mapsource product for all of my uploads to the pc. the problem with mapsource is the level of detail. its scale is : vs. topo's : ... but at least it works.",1

"i bought this program to make simple family newsletters, student handouts, and various other projects. i have found it fairly easy to use with lots of pictures, fun fonts and pre-made projects. my daughter, who is has been able to make birthday cards for friends and family without much difficulty. there are no written instructions so you have to feel your way through most of it; this is a simple process although a bit time consuming at the start. the one feature i am very disappointed with is the picture/graphics search option. when looking for graphics you literally have to scroll through each section beginning to end to find a graphic; there is a search option but even very general searches (like ""flower"") usually produce no results. basically the search option is useless which makes finding the graphics you want a tedious and sometimes long process.for what i want to do this program works just fine and i have used it with worthwhile results.",1

"bottom line, off the top: if you have win / , upgrade. if you have win k, stay right where you are.for all the pretty screens and rounded buttons that ms slaps on their products, winxp is still windows, and still prone to the same issues that plague the many versions of windows. it's still somewhat unstable (no os is crashproof, by the way), insecure, and a complete resource hog. they have cleaned up the networking components (the connection sharing piece is very inuitive), and while the gui is nice, i noticed definite slowdowns.value-adds: ie is more of the same. windows media is invasive (it logs every piece of media you play) bloatware. it was great around version , when it was thin, fast, and played music without complication. use winamp or sonique. built-in cd copying is kludgy at very best; use a third-party app for truly efficient, fast cd-writing.all in all? not bad. win k with more hand-holding and more cpu-choking graphics...",1
